If you‚Äôve followed tesla enough you know that analysts were consistent underestimating them for a while. Then out of nowhere they started ‚Äúestimating‚Äù 60-70% growth leading to tesla ‚Äúmissing‚Äù which would lead to a drop and a fast recover which was easy to play.

This site catalogues weekly data on NEV registrations with the chinese government and can be used as a source for BYD's chinese sales. You might do better following twitter accounts and using their sources however.

Considering Investing in Tesla (TSLA) - Seeking Feedback from the Community,Let's be clear: The United States government and major auto will never allow a Chinese car manufacturer into our space. The US doesn't care if the Chinese make our cheap stuff and things at Walmart but once you mention disrupting our major industries it's game over. Anybody betting on Chinese EVs in the US would be better served using their cash as kindling.,They will either partner with a US OEM or set up manufacturing based in US to get round import tariffs. There are already Chinese parts suppliers in US that have done this. It will happen.

A utility company by me is building a peak power backup /stabilizer utilizing Tesla batteries. Once more batteries become available I think we‚Äôll see better adoption but don‚Äôt be surprised if it is from grid operators. There are plenty of wildly successful companies that only sell to business. Time will tell.

But I think it will weigh down TSLA by 10-15% or something like that. I don‚Äôt think that percentage is going to grow so in my opinion Tesla is a buy after a great Q4.
