"In the early years of Tesla, what I thought many others didn't appreciate about Tesla was the fact that they had extraordinary talent: those noteworthy in their fields to have their own Wikipedia article. That's required to fight entropy: the many ways in which you can fail vs the few ways you succeed in building an all new car company that makes BEVs viable. I think the legends that left Tesla include Jim Keller (processor architecture, hardware for autopilot), JB Straubel(battery design, CTO for 15 years and the soul of the company to me), and now Karpathy (AI computer vision, self driving). They were all not just good, but revolutionary in their fields. Tesla still has a contract Jeff Dahn (NMC cell co-inventor), and a great team overall with solid foundations. However it seems like a different company: less extraordinary, now. This may have no correlation with profitability, but I think it does impact the magnitude of innovative steps they make. More recently still, well Musk self imploded and all the safety controls to stop him have left the company.",03-01-2023,118.4700012,108.0999985

"I think people finally woke up to the fact that Tesla is really just a car company. There's no meta-energy-integration one stop shop, as evidenced by them cancelling many of their solar roof projects. The autopilot is like you having to supervise an over-cautious teenager. Full autonomous driving is years and years away (if ever). The technology is ahead of other EV's, but everyone else is catching up. It's nice to spout off pipe dreams and grand designs, but in the end, the valuation should be closer to a Ford or GM rather than Apple or Microsoft.",03-01-2023,118.4700012,108.0999985

"Bought the dip and got a couple of shares today for an average price of 105€.

"What people often don't realize.... Tesla's meteoric rise in 2020... Was in many ways a short squeeze. Elon sold the dream, Tesla started to hit mainstream, and Tesla was heavily shorted. Fed when Brrrr.... Newly enriched retail clamors to Tesla.... Squeeze people like Burry... who fundamentally knew it was overvalued. So in reality this is just the delayed correction as retail is starting to lose their resolve under the pressure of a bear market. Retail just doesn't have the funds to DCA and keep the stock up. Tesla also doesn't have the institutional ownership like Apple to stabilize it's decline. All good, Tesla still has the best engineering in the industry and it will prevail in the long run. Elon does need to get out of its way now. He was great for the pump...but it has now proven to be a double edged sword. He really just need to focus on SpaceX and let someone else take the reins at Tesla.",03-01-2023,118.4700012,108.0999985

700? Like before the two splits? Or before the last split? Because if it was before any split you would be at a pt of $46.67 if it was after the first split but before the last split it would be $233.34 which is still down -55%ish but not down -85%. I don't think TSLA reached 700 post this last split. So...you may be up or down but not -85%.,03-01-2023,118.4700012,108.0999985

"Former Tesla here. Tesla began it's death march about 6 months before JB walked out. It was obvious to all of us he'd had it with trying to police Elon and was only doing the bare minimum those final months. Elon cried when he announced JBs exit...I will always maintain those tears were not out of sadness for losing JB, but because Elon knew he was fucked. The guy who literally made Tesla and allowed Elon to take credit for all his work was leaving. There's a few other Tesla rockstars missing from your list, who ultimately either jumped or got pushed (with Elon, it's usually one and the same), but I agree JB was the day that Tesla changed forever and began turning into what it is today.",03-01-2023,118.4700012,108.0999985
"Imo, Tesla hasn’t put anything on the market that is innovative in around 3-4 years. Legacy auto makers are dropping new cars with what feels like daily occurrence that have equal or better features, performance, and/or price points.

When you go to work for Tesla at a senior level you are no longer just working at a car company, now it looks like you're directly endorsing and supporting all the whacky pseudo white nationalist hardcore alt-righty shit Musk tweets about non-stop while he is 'working'. It's also a notoriously shit working culture and life. Its not worth it really anymore to join Tesla if you are at the top of your field. He's outed himself as an incompetent middle manager who fell upward and the kind of manager who tells uncomfortable jokes in meetings and then fires people for not stroking his ego and laughing at them.",03-01-2023,118.4700012,108.0999985

I’d be lying if at some point I didn’t second guess myself though, given how well the stock kept performing.. But there is nothing luxurious about a Tesla. It’s minimalist, but that’s a style, not a superior product. Still, some will argue. Oh and I can’t wait for their HD flop… big rigs are a WHOLE different animal.

Literally the only thing that stands out about tsla as an auto manufacturer is that their quality is quite awful. They can’t get their promised technology out so there goes the “tech” company. They can’t make an affordable sedan so the “every man” car is out. They are missing their own projected manufacturing numbers so there goes the “growth” company. Elon as sullied his own reputation so there goes the “genius ceo” company. As an auto manufacturer they make EVs. They make about 1.3m a year. The other big auto manufacturers can make 250k per plant and they have dozens of them. They can produce evs on most flex lines and can adapt a plant in between 16 weeks to 12 months to fully retool and build evs. Anything that tsla had that was special has had its veil lifted. They have nothing special to offer that the other manufacturers can’t at this point. It’s complete mask off for elon.,03-01-2023,118.4700012,108.0999985

However those type of quality standards offer a greater insight into their level of competency in production among other things.

"It's because redditors put way too much self importance on themselves. If you look at Reddit, you would assume that Tesla is crashing and burning. If you look at reality, Tesla just hit a company all time delivery record last quarter even though their vehicles are significantly more expensive than two years ago. If you look at reality, Tesla has been increasing their market share over the years, not decreasing, as competitors come online Most redditors who hate Teslas haven't even been in a Tesla. They just parrot what they hear on Reddit. Also, as a big Tesla fan I'm still able to make money from puts. It was pretty obvious that the rising interest rate environment was going to kill and gut any single growth company. Tesla is dropping just a much as other big growth names like Amazon, meta, Nvidia, and others. Tesla and Amazon are exactly as promising as they were a year ago, they just have to be priced differently with the end of free money printing. Once Tesla starts with hitting <60-70 or so, it's going to be just as good an investment opportunity as it was in 2019. I remember the same exact sentiment happened with Apple online a decade ago.

"Assuming he did take a good look at the pic before he posted it and new who was in it, what is bad abt posting a picture of a Nazi? Is there anything inherently wrong with that? I understand context is important here, and I think most people would say that’s fine if it’s in a historical sense, eg. learning abt WW2 the nazis and showing pics of them. But in this case it’s an obv joke abt unchecked messages and I think it’s a stretch to say he supports Nazis just cause he used a pic of one with a pigeon cage on their back.

whats the martket share of those vehicles? The Hummer and Corvette EV is insanely low. EV trucks are quite niche as well especially for anyone that uses a truck to haul or tow as the batterie life drops by 50% or more. The blazer and bolts are the only ones that will compete with the Tesla lineup. Like I said the EV with the highest market share was the Nissan leaf and that was usurped buy Tesla for the last 4 years and has been on the decline ever since.

Besides Nvidia and Google maybe. So ‍♂️ Peanuts or not, it is essential to look at these things in perspective. Will EVs or ICE cars dominate the world in 5-10 years? If EVs will dominate, how much resources will other companies require to rebuild their current pipeline to catch up with Tesla? How much will it cost in money/time? When will it happen? What will Tesla become then, considering their current operational power? What resources and infrastructure will Tesla have 10 years from now?

"Tesla is a stock that very rarely traded on fundamentals imo but was driven almost entirely on Elon musk premium. He has done irreparable damage to his reputation and people have lost faith in him. Actually the only way he could restore his reputation at this point is to deliver on some of his promises, namely actual FSD/a mass production cyber truck/working semi/mass production working dancing robot. Since I don’t expect them to deliver on any of that though I think it easily goes back to where it was in the $20-$50 range. People laugh about Nikola but Tesla isn’t a whole lot better- 2/3 of its products are basically faked/promoted to pump its stock. Think of these “leaked” videos of the Tesla semi driving around the desert. People have finally gotten wise to the fact that he is basically a stock promoter.",03-01-2023,118.4700012,108.0999985

However, if EVs become the new form of transportation big oil will start to hurt in the long run thus game theory occurs where they are forced to take action earlier by either suppressing this form of technology or making it obsolete and the way they might do this is having China’s middle class afford cheap cars and thus being able to export their oil into China, who will continue to use and ignore emissions standards across not only cars but everything else or EE, which would further create a crisis of polluting the atmosphere which in turn will eventually melt Antarctica which could have been the plan from the beginning, and when Antarctica melts there is no telling what is waiting under the ice, yearning for so long",03-01-2023,118.4700012,108.0999985

My point exactly. They and many others have had issues in the last. No reason to treat Tesla any different when it has shown the same resilience. It’s just been an over priced stock for like a decade now. And literally nobody involved with them denied it. Stock price $= company quality. It hasn’t since the 60s.

Yes it should. Again GM is not growing in sales they are losing. Tesla is one of the only car companies growing. At a rate of 40%+. But I agree fair value is much much lower. I would not buy back in unless it was around $40-$50,03-01-2023,118.4700012,108.0999985

I have driven a Tesla. They are also down significantly more than other growth stocks this last 12 months. Over 70% right now. It’s just all my opinion from experience in the auto industry. I can’t see they have much going for them as far as a competitive edge. There used to be a lot but it’s become too drawn out. The circumstances you could have used to justify an insane valuation just aren’t there anymore. Even after taking a 70% hit they’re still insanely valued. They have a long way to drop still.

"Metallurgy is an extremely complicated thing. If you know how cars are made you know sheet metal is stamped into pieces, fitted together by robots or people, spot welded, re welded and then assembled as an entire frame, body and shell. It’s quite the challenge to make all those parts fit together. As you can imagine dies wear out, weld tips wear out, tooling and fixtures wear out. They wear out by the millimetres of course but add up enough mm’s and you have cm’s. So from start to finish parts of the car can be way out of alignment by the time you’re done. You need to have good precision measurement and process control to correct this. Lasers and high precisions machines and what not. Tsla apparently does not do this very well because if you look at a hood or a door, the gaps between some seams will be way more than another. The average person won’t notice a mm or so but a cm or two, yes. They also don’t install interior paneling very well or trim pieces or weather seals. So not only can they not do the hard shit they fuck up a lot of easy shit too. That’s because manufacturing and assembly relies on non skilled labor to semi skilled labor to highly skilled labor. And it relies on a lot of it. So it’s easy to have shit slip through the cracks if you have poor quality control. Hundreds, if not thousands of hands touch the car during the manufacturing and assembly process. Tsla just doesn’t have the greatest quality control. It’s true that it will go unbeknownst to most people. But it will at best a minor inconvenience to some to possibly catastrophic for the car.",03-01-2023,118.4700012,108.0999985
"Actually since ev cars take way less space to manufacture, plants are literally building batteries on site or across the street in some cases.

"I mean yes you can. If you want to get into the nitty gritty of specific brands and specific models you can look at areas of growth and market share. Other auto manufacturers are making dozens or hundreds of different models. Some models do poorly, some do extraordinarily well.

Especially as other, larger auto manufacturers are in the cusp of entering the same market en masse. We’re talking about your local craft burger shop competing with MacDonald’s. Yes they have a great burger but it’s another entire thing to own the world market on the most commonly sought burger.

"Get Musks dick out off your ass… Tesla runs on their FSD scam and PR alone. Tesla had years to improve their quality and didn‘t give a fuck. Musk constantly makes shit up / promises stuff he can‘t deliver (cheaper (faster built) tunnels that cost more and take longer to complete, reusable rockets that take forever to be reused and could very well be built from scratch without changing the costs much (unless he scams another government), tesla taxis that should‘ve been here for years and have an ROI of >100% p.a., colonies on Mars in 2 years, manned missions to mars in the past, solar roofs that didn‘t exist (and if they did as claimed they would be terrible), creating a semi that can‘t carry enough cargo to be viable, humanoid robots that are actors in suits, bullet proof glass that isn‘t bullet proof, …). Tesla is the definition of generating hype for stuff that won‘t work and underdelivering on every promise. That‘s the only thing you can count on. Sure. Buying a Tesla is a flex (or well… was a flex). But that‘s it. Tesla doesn‘t really appeal to the mainstream and the elite expects more quality. Tesla had a good run and they‘ll likely stick around for a while since they somehow managed to convince people that they‘re a technology company and not a car manufacturer but they‘re on the decline and I really doubt that they‘ll be anything but a niche company unless they create something really special.

"Cisco is a good company?! I have used their products for over 15 years and buy tens of millions of their hardware. It’s the worst I’ve ever seen it. It suck now. Buggiest software to date, high failure rate of hardware. They are both an industry leader and visionary for software bugs when it comes to networking. We have had to pass on all their recent software offerings (for years) because every product has different and convoluted licensing that doesn’t interact with each other yet requires all products to be in licensing compliance in order to use any of their advanced features (the software they are trying to sell). Therefore we use none. They are just a hardware company to us now. I literally can’t use the products (software) they are offering and over the last 5 years it’s put us in a position where we can easily dump their entire product line for a competitor because nothing we use is proprietary. They have our money for now so I guess that is good for them but we will be going out to bid for replacement of all their stuff in 2023. They took a monopoly at my company and made themselves expendable. I talk to others in my field and it’s the same thing. We can lift and shift to another vendor without impact. Fucking nuts.

The overvaluation is what is dangerous considering how over inflated the stock price is compared to the competition. The competitors production numbers and stock price are in line. They are producing and selling versus stock price is not completely distorted. Tesla is not in sync at all. Cheap debt is driving this company Tesla off of a cliff. Elon Musk delving into another company like Twitter makes sense when you realize that a major correction must come at some point. He is working on a human brain to computer interface and his company is probably working on AI. Self driving cars and SpaceX and it’s space program and the satellite internet. But some of these other technologies haven’t produced significant results as of yet. This is why Musk is shitting on Open AI since Chat GPT came out. He didn’t get the first mover advantage so he is attacking it. Even though the initial seed money came from him.,07-01-2023,,

"Tesla was extremely overvalued for a very long time, but now they're down to about 30% of what they were at their peak. I dunno if this is their new bottom. I still think they have value as a company and let's face it, they're still making the best EVs on the market. But I wouldn't be betting either direction right now. When a company is in free fall like this, there's no predicting what will happen. There's very often a bounce back at the end as the panic fades. But there's a very good chance we're still in the fall and haven't hit the bottom. Or it find its new price point and stabilize. Basically any investment right now is a total gamble based off of extremely little real data. Personally I'd wait to invest until Elon Musk announces he's stepping down. There will almost certainly be a small bump after that announcement.",07-01-2023,,

"Tesla got obliterated in China by the $5k Wuling Mini, which is now the world's top selling EV. It took just a few months to outsell the Teslas in China probably on account of it being ~10% of the price. It's made by a joint venture between GM and couple Chinese companies. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuling_Hongguang_Mini_EV Tesla gets criticized for cheap interiors, low build quality, which is valid on a $61k car, but expected on a $5k car. One reason Tesla has lower margins, is they don't have as many stores as the other manufacturers. A Tesla in Fargo might not have the range to go to the dealer in Minneapolis when it needs dealer service, but most of the other manufacturers have dealers in Fargo. This will limit Tesla's sales, unless they lower their margins. I'm having a hard time thinking of a manufacturer that doesn't already have an electric car.

Tesla paid their debts back to the government as soon as they could so they could continue to borrow at lower and lower rates until they were cash positive and have vertically integrated year after year after year from fresh factories built around their designs from the ground up. They are a well oiled machine at this point. It pays to be a head of the curve. Retrofitting and retooling is expensive. Legacy companies and especially VW have had to borrow at insane rates to do a 180 to try and catch up with the EV trend as well as pay back fines from dieselgate as well as investments in Electrify America. But debt doesn’t tell the whole story.

In China, that salary is closer to $15k/year, so a Tesla is at least double that. EV or not, the disruptive car in the US is going to be the one that gets sold cheap, like the Model T or the VW Beetle. Tesla promised that early on, that they were going to keep making cheaper cars until they got to that Model T or VW beetle level and make zillions of them for the masses, and the stock is priced for them to do that, but they have yet to.

"> In my opinion Tesla has a false premium for being first to market. They don't have the networks that Toyota has and no longer have a technical advantage. This is very shortsighted. Yes, they have a premium for being first to market. But that's not really true - they're just the first *good* option to market. And while they don't have the networks traditional car companies have, they *do* still have a technical advantage. Other car companies are *thoroughly* entrenched in the traditional manufacturing process and, to be completely honest, do not have the capital it would require to invest in modernizing their production. I'm not saying Tesla is on top, but there *is* a reason their valuation was so ridiculously high, and it's because the market has literally zero faith in their competition. The reason Tesla is coming back down is because the market no longer has faith in Tesla either. But that's not an endorsement of their competition. If Tesla doesn't implode, I still don't know how any traditional car company can truly compete with them over the long term. I suspect most will die.",07-01-2023,,

You’re 100% right, I made a shitty argument using the steering wheel falling off article.

Retooling lines for a chassis and drop on shell on a legacy factory vs retooling a drop on shell in a brand new built from ground up factory for am existing chassis is a different thing all together. The unibody and structural battery design of the Model y will more than likely be adopted for the model 3 and the new yet to be announced cheaper option and maybe even the Model S and even the CT. Tesla is in a much better situation to adapt on the fly than legacy manufacturers to produce new designs in mass quantities as 3 of their 4 gigafactories were all built within 2 years of each other. Its simply unfathomable to think of the two situations legacy automakers and tesla have found themselves in. It’ll be really fun to see how the two compare a decade from now.

"Hallmark movies do well because they are basically softcore wish fulfillment porn specifically laser targeted at women during the holidays, they're not actually good movies, it's the same recycled plot over and over again, woman meets super attractive man, man already has bitchy fiance/ex/Ms wrong, woman hits it off with him, turns out they're perfect for each other, plot happens, they fall in love and man dumps Ms wrong (wife makes me watch them every year). I think this actually helps explain why overly ""woke"" movies tend to do poorly though. Hallmark movies wouldn't do well at the box office, even if they did have a big budget, because they are so laser focused on one specific segment of the population (adult white women) that the majority of people have no interest in watching it, or can't get someone to go watch it with them. If you make a movie where one of the main plot points is ""oh these main characters are LBGTQ"", and you spend half the movie harping on it, you've narrowed down your target audience to people who care about that issue enough to watch a movie about it, which means it's probably not going to draw a big enough audience for a theatre release. Marvel movies get away with having ""woke"" stuff because it's not the main focus of the movie and they have AAA celebrity actors in the movies that people want to see, but even marvel movies like ""captain marvel"" did poorly compared to other marvel movies with more prominent actors. Personally I was thrown for a loop in Endgame because I had no clue who captain marvel was when she showed up halfway through the movie with the filmmakers just assuming you'd watched her movie and knew who she was.",09-01-2023,118.9599991,119.7699966

Thanks for listing out some differences. As a consumer most of those differences don't appeal to me. As in I'm glad they don't have a dealer network as cutting middle men out would be awesome but the benefit to me is I'd expect to pay less and have a streamlined experience but I still pay just as much because Tesla takes the profits. Unions I see as a good thing if a company is abusing it's workforce but yes technically a consumer might benefit from less overhead if the auto maker passes on the costs savings of no union. Tesla doesn't and abuses it's workforce. Data is only useful if what you are collecting is valuable. Turns out 2D images aren't that useful compared to the 3D data of Lidar. All the app stuff while neat I can do on all my tablets. I'd find it a hindrance and distraction as a driver with someone messing with my console screen for extended periods of time. There is also the downside of no physical knobs which might turn a few off. The charging network is nice but only if you cannot put a charger in your home. Most don't need a charger network unless you travel long distances. The charging at home is huge for me as I'd save let's say 30 minutes a month / 6 hours of my life per year avoiding fueling but I can get this from any EV. I know the importance of this for those worries about range or the need for a fill up but for me it doesn't benefit me as I rarely travel long distances. I connect to zoom on my phone. It seems good enough that no one cares that my car does it. I'm not one that likes to be spied on via telematics. Maybe could benefit from cost savings but if history teaches me anything the price drop would only be temporary until we are all tracked in our cars and cannot drive without it. I don't see myself spying on my car much but no doubt it's useful like all cameras are in a car when things go wrong. Mostly I use insurance for that though. Pet mode is useful too for somr but I have no pets. The light stuff is a bit flashy and not useful to me. I'd try it once and forget about it. I do like interior lights for a luxury feel but it's a nice to have that many auto makers offer. Tesla's FSD just isn't there yet and I suspect it will take much longer than Musk wants everyone to believe. I suspect it sells well because many believed Musk would deliver but still not there yet. I do like the self updating but only if they don't brick my car. It's not enough of a selling point for me though to buy it. In the end realistically they should be able to offer a cheaper car for less because they are out manufacturing other car manufacturers with new techniques but that all went out the window with the pandemic and them ratcheting prices up aggressively. Streamlined manufacturing is great if the product is amazing but they still struggle with even basic quality controls and luxury prices without the luxury look and feel.,09-01-2023,118.9599991,119.7699966

"If a popular beer cuts its price to become one of the most attractive on the market in that product range, their margin will reduce, correct.

"I actually would say most people shouldn't buy a beater. If you can't fix it yourself, don't buy a beater. Especially now, rusty beaters in PA for example cost $3000-$5000 and won't even pass inspection so it's the absolute worst time to buy a beater. Instead, you typically would want to buy a 3-5 year old used car and drive it until maintenance costs become rather expensive or it rusts out. Under current market conditions, this is not an option due to pricing. You'll spend just about what a new car costs. Under current market conditions, the only sensible option is to buy or lease a new car with minimalistic options. Leasing can work well for someone that doesn't drive a ton, while buying a new car is preferable for people that wanna put miles on it. I'm very fortunate to have gotten a 14 Expedition EL with 155k miles for only $8300 back in 2020. Can't buy anything close to that price these days! I'll be driving that till the wheels fall off it seems. Though to be honest, the Ford Maverick *could* in the future be a feasible replacement. The $22k base model with the standard hybrid gets like 40 MPG but is sadly only FWD. The better motor has an AWD option, but then the gas mileage is down to 30 or so. If they released the basic hybrid with AWD for 25k or so, I'd probably be able to justify the purchase with the gas mileage improvement, value of a new car warranty, and the obvious years less of use. It's the only near sensible car upgrade for me I see on the market currently, and it's still flawed.",13-01-2023,116.5500031,122.4000015

"Price drops are gonna cut hard into Tesla's margins, but the margins were already stupid high. Remember the 3 and Y weren't supposed to be super luxury cars, that's the S and X. Prices had to go up because the wait times were like 6 months. Now we're in a recession and the prices are coming back to earth.

Potentially yes. But their margins will take a big hit and the bull thesis was dependent on them maintaining or improving margins while scaling up. The stock is worth a fraction of what it is now but the company itself will be just fine. I think people have a hard time separating share price from company performance. If they scale unit volume but have poor margins they just become another auto manufacturer. Not a tech company if their margins are a tiny fraction of a normal tech company.

"The only issue I have with the dealer is sometimes they’re backed up for a month depending on what city I’m in. You can get your oil changed elsewhere, or do it yourself, so really not too bad to just schedule it in for routine maintenance. Denver, and Dallas, and Minneapolis have the worst backup I’ve experienced, but some places I can get in within a few days. ‍♂️ I’ve always had great experiences with my sales rep, although I don’t deal with them much as I know what I’m getting when I arrive to purchase the vehicle, quick and simple every time. My last Hyundai vehicle purchase was complete in less than an hour. The service department has always provided adequate, to great customer service. Again, the only bad thing I’ve experienced is the possible wait to get in for service. I have owned numerous Hyundais since 2017, and will continue to do so. I used to be a big Honda guy since my first car in 2007. I might note that I also work in the auto repair industry, and get behind the wheel of many different makes/models. Not many impress me more than newer generation Hyundais, until you get to really high end vehicles. I only get limited or better trims, so can’t speak on lesser trims. To each their own, I’m just happy that they are making improvements, and really trying to garner attention, while proving they are a noteworthy car manufacturer. Other companies seem to be the opposite, once the pinnacle, now on a decline, lacking innovation in both design, tech, and reliability. I’m not saying Hyundai is the best car by any means, but for the money, I think you get one hell of a car, especially the Elantra limited.",13-01-2023,116.5500031,122.4000015

"I completely agree buying an off-lease low-milage car. But I think buying new now is not the worst you could do with used car prices still high -- as long as you get a 5-year loan and plan to drive it for at least 3 years after paying it off. Especially since you'll get a better interest rate from a manufacturer's lending arm for a new car than from banks for a used car loan. I regretted buying a new car in 2015, but now that it's been paid off for a bit I love it. With over 100,000 miles, it's still going strong because I've treated it right and had good service along the way. It will need some more expensive work like another new set of brakes and timing belt soon, but other than that it's good to know I don't have to worry about repairs AND a payment. The obsession with having a new shiny thing just doesn't appeal to me anymore. I'm honestly hoping I can drive my car for at least another 5 years to 175,000+ miles.",13-01-2023,116.5500031,122.4000015

"The core problem with sex in the workplace is that people in the workforce will use sex with the boss to get unfair advantages and unscrupulous bosses will use their workplace power over subordinates to force or coerce them into sex. This by and large creates a lot of problems. This is why the Matt Lauer lock the door button was a problem. Having sex wasn't the problem. The ability to ensure no one could come in and save the intern from unwanted sexual activity he was trying to start was the problem. If two co-workers decide they want a relationship and go to HR and properly disclose it and ensure conflicts of interest are resolved? No issues. There's virtually always a path to doing it legitimately even if it annoys the hell out of HR to do that. When you're fucking all your supervisors to get glowing reviews... you end up with a serious problem. Not because people are having sex, but because there's not clarify that people didn't feel like it was free and other staff feel they can't get those opportunities without being strong armed into sex with co-workers too.",16-01-2023,,

The market has a way of catching up on tech pretty quickly when it needs to. Scaling production is a time consuming process though with a bunch of its own challenges along the way.

"Heres another, cuckservative. From a conservative news outlet, 7 years before the NYT article i posted. It is a well established fact that economies perform better under democratic policies, and suffer when cockslurplicans slash taxes for their rich asshole buddies. You're the party of ""lets bootlick the billionaires"". Its a fact that red states are poorer, more dependent on welfare (federal dollars paid from other states), and the citizens are on welfare at a higher rate. Reagan caused a recession. Hoover caused a recession. Bush Jr caused a recession. Trump caused a recession.... and each time, the uneducated portion of america blamed their political opponents. This is what happens when you research things, and dont live in a feeble, delusional reality like conservatives do. You learn things, and you realize you were wrong. https://www.economist.com/united-states/2014/08/09/timing-is-everything",17-01-2023,125.6999969,131.4900055

"Laughable market response on the idea that Tesla was somehow oversold. (It's up 50% merely on that). The earnings report was not good. They beat the markets estimates, but everything was down. Earnings growth rate was down, revenue growth rate was down, margins were the lowest in 5 quarters. And the guidance was point blank that ""margins would continue to decline"" Outlook. Spending will continue to cool in the US thruout 2023 with cutbacks to big ticket items. While the labor market remains strong, the YOLO spending of 2021, 2022 will end in 2023 as consumers excess savings run out, and they will start to constrain their debt spending. US is Teslas best market. Interest rates will stay high for longer or Fed crashes economy. Either way: Tesla will not grow deliveries anywhere near 50% in 2023.

"That's what's being said by Redditors. If you look at his channel, he's young and traveling all over the US and the world, and seems to be grinding content to make his vlogging a thing. He even has videos about ""How to go viral"", which doesn't mean he's an expert, but it does mean he's thought about it. His view counts aren't terrible to start and are fairly consistent, and he's been at this for a decent chunk of time now with regular uploads and decent editing. I don't know what people are looking at, but I see a well spoken young guy who is doing a content series, looks fairly clean with a fairly clean car, and looks social-media presentable. This looks like a content creator doing a thing for content, even if his traveling minimalist lifestyle is real. The comments saying he's a gambler seem misleading unless there's something I'm missing, since his comment about gambling is referring to the stocks. I don't doubt the loss is genuine (12k invested supposedly), but how much content did he produce from his stock vlogging arch and how much buzz is he going to generate based on being on Page 1 of Reddit and WSB? Is that worth 12k? If people can prove he's pissing away all of his money (beyond the 12k he sunk into this), sure. But if he's really a gainfully employed software engineer who's just traveling with minimum expenditures for content, that changes the picture a lot, and I could see him trending to 5 figure and then 6 figure viewer counts if he pivots his content correctly.

"If you owe a company money in the U.S., the company will try to collect from you directly via a politely worded letter and balance statement. If you don't pay or contact them to negotiate a payment plan, after a certain amount of time they'll consider you dead to them and will sell your debt (and other deadbeats' unpaid debt) to a debt collection company (I've heard of them referred to as ""mills"" before). This company will call you every day to get your deadbeat ass to fork over the money (note: under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, they aren't supposed to call you before 8am or after 9pm, nor should they call you more than once per day per debt), and while you can ask them to stop calling (they might oblige) or just ignore their calls (fuck those blood-sucking leeches), but they're just gonna keep calling. Eventually this company will consider you dead to them, and they might sell your debt to another company or file a civil suit against you so you have to show up in court and explain to a judge why you are such a degenerate loser gambler with a small dick but really a nicely-shaped one though and then you'll probably end up having your wages garnished; aka a percentage of your paycheck gets deducted until your debt is paid off or you are dead.

"> It's the age of wealth inequality, but that doesn't mean only 5 people have money and everyone else is starving. Ehh, it kind of does though. Yes, the pure number of people with money is a larger number than 5, but as a portion of all people, it might as well be 5. And funnily enough on the topic of 5, barely over 5% of U.S. workers make 100k/yr or more. Meanwhile, at the bottom one HALF make 30k/yr or less. > The top 1% of Americans are people making 11 million and up. There are a lot of households with millions in equity, savings, investments, etc. Nope. If you make 250k/yr or more, you're in the top 1% of earners. Millionaires are RICH rich, and a MINUSCULE percentage of people in the U.S. And yes, I know if you google how many there are in the U.S., it will tell you about 6% or so. But that alone proves just how few are working / how much inherited wealth there is, considering about 1/2 of Americans are not working, and probably around 0.3% maybe of working people are clearing over a million a year in income. > What we see in people posting massive wins and losses with large investment funds are people either gambling their life savings, using inherited funds, or using acquired wealth from their position in the top 10% of Americans. I'm very fortunate to make a good salary, and yes I live in a city that's a *little* HCOL, but not crazily, yet even so, I wouldn't be comfortable risking more than a few thousand bucks in stocks/crypto.

"Well not to be.. ""that guy at the party"" but you're mostly correct, depending on the supercharger. Twin-screw, aka Eaton aka Roots-type whine as they are like two screws turning, compressing air and creating a unique (and to some, intoxicating) sound! =) Centrifugal superchargers in the simplest sense are like turbos that are belt driven instead of using exhaust gasses to turn the turbine.. they too ""whistle"" (if we're talking turbine spool sounds not blow-off valve sounds here, which both types also contain) Brand examples: Paxton, Procharger and Vortech Biggest benefit of Centrifugal supercharger over turbo charger are = Instantaneous spool vs ""turbo lag"" But biggest (2) drawbacks are: Parasitic drag (Takes HP to make hp in this case. F1A prochargers can take well over 100hp just to ""turn"" them!)

Depending on how far itm you go, you get closer to 1-1 price movement with the stock. Ex. You buy a TSLA240119C100 today for $7300; then, 6 months from now the stock is at $200; based on the current delta, that contract would then be worth roughly $10780 (minus lost time value).

Reality is, you buy the contract(s) for 1k, and instead of waking up to them only being worth $900 and selling, admitting wrongness or whatever, you wake up and they are literally worth $50.

Selling options doesn’t always mean way more risk. In fact selling puts on a stock you want anyway is probably less risky than buying calls for it; you get premium for selling it and then if you get assigned you now own the stock so it’s not like you lost unless it’s a shit stock and it tanks super hard. And once you have the stock you can write covered calls against those shares and get more premium. Run the wheel baby!

I’m not saying don’t ever sell options but you have to have an even greater understanding because the potential loss is hypothetically infinite but when you buy contracts you can only lose the purchase price.

The part that's also missed from the post is that Tesla's model is not keeping inventory at all and is the reason they cut prices.

Model 3 is best selling car. Model Y is best selling SUV. 1 and 2 in overall vehicle sales.

Gasoline is the most expensive in the continental US. Greater charging infrastructure than anywhere in the world. EVs make more sense in California than anywhere in the US or world currently.

"“Toyotas are the cheapest to maintain in the long run, costing just 13.5% of their average worth over 10 years” This is what your article said. Did you read the article or did you see Toyota 13% and Tesla 7%, 13 > 7 therefore Tesla is cheaper to maintain? You do know 50% of 100 is less than 25% of 1000. Tesla cost much more than a Toyota. The two brands aren’t even competing in the same market. A Toyota can start at 20k with a Corolla while the cheapest Tesla starts at 35k with model S. Using the numbers listed by the article, the Corolla would cost 2600 while the model S would cost around 2400 in maintenance fee. $200 difference, but you paid 15K more for the Tesla… Also a used Camry does not lock you out of any features that the original owners had, but better cough up [$8000](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21127243/tesla-model-s-autopilot-disabled-remotely-used-car-update) if you want the full Tesla feature that was already unlocked on the car",12-02-2023,,

Another thing to do is not sell a call during earnings weeks and to always sell a call during the dividend week. Hope to get your shares called and then buy back after the dividend when the stock usually goes down the amount of the dividend.

"Heres where these ideas come from. Honda, a company that is basically the company Tesla may grow into someday--a company with 10% of the car market and a side gig in robotics, is worth 1/12th of Tesla at Tesla's current value. They sell 5x more cars than Tesla, but with the growth in the EV market I share your confidence that someday Tesla can match them. Tesla has 68% of the EV market and rapidly dropping (It was over 80% just a couple of years ago). Even if you believe in some sort of weird scenario where Tesla ended up selling more than 50% of the cars in the world (which seems highly implausible based on current trends) they actually need to sell **more** than 100% of the cars in the world just to justify their current valuation. As you may be aware, that's mathematically impossible. You basically have to be believing that they will sell 90% of the cars in the world, have a thriving robotaxi service (despite the fact that Uber doesn't make any money and that Tesla's self driving is a decade away from being able to do something like that at an absolute minimum), and selling a robot to every family in America at significant profit. It's just never going to happen. And let's not even discuss their huge liability for the inevitable class action when they get sued for selling a $10k self driving feature while knowing full well the cars in question would never be capable of such in their expected lifetimes.",12-02-2023,,

There wasn’t really an option unless you want to drop obscene money on Porsche or settle for really niche products that had glaring flaws. Now almost everyone is building EVs. In two years, the market has provided a ton of optionality. In two more years, there will be even more. GM alone made 2.2m or so cars last year- when I’m talking about competition, I’m thinking about everyone switching over to EV from ice and erasing the novelty factor Tesla enjoys today. As for my polestar example- again, 2 years ago it wasn’t even an option and it now is. In the early 80’s, IBMs PC was it for home computers.

"Respect for explaining your thinking. That said, you’re ignoring the facts that matter most. Profitability and growth rate. Stock price attempts to predict the future earnings of a company. For that you need to know how much profit is made per unit and how fast profit is growing (among a hundred other things). I don’t have Honda’s unit profitability data, so perhaps you can check that too if you’d like, but for example: in Q3 22 Tesla had over $9k net profit per vehicle. Other major car companies net profit per vehicle: GM $2k Toyota $1.1k VW $900 Ford -$700 > You basically have to be believing that they will sell 90% of the cars in the world So it’s cool to make a statement like the above. They sound cool and all. But that ignores profit entirely. If Tesla’s profit per vehicle is several times that of the other companies, no one need forecast 90% market share. It also ignores the other part of the stock price equation: growth rate. Tesla has grown more than 100% every 2 years for the last 10 years. About 40% per year. Their guidance is average 50% per year going forward. Other car companies’ annual growth rates as of Q3 2022: Ford flat BMW negative 6% Toyota negative 15% Honda negative 38% So, yeah, if we ignore that Honda (and nearly all non Chinese car companies) are shrinking AND we ignore that they make almost no profit, and we squint, we might be able to compare Honda to Tesla like you did. But it requires torturing the data to the point of having an agenda rather than trying to understand what’s actually happening. It’s like phones. Everyone got distracted by “android is on so many more devices!!!!” when iPhones make 80% of the profit of the entire phone market. It’s easy to get distracted by random production or installation numbers. But we have to build our investment opinions on the most relevant facts if we want to make money. Notice we haven’t had to forecast energy, AI, or bots, like you suggest. If you just forecast the above continuing a few more years, Tesla is close to fair value already.",12-02-2023,,

I get it but it’s a weak argument in my opinion. Seems like people are in denial of teslas dominance. Their margins are insane and they’re moving huge numbers of vehicles. They’re about to be the best selling vehicle in the world this year and they already made more than ford and GM combined off those two models. The Tesla haters just keep moving the goal posts. This reminds me when apple was taking over the phone market and everyone kept saying that there was an iPhone killer coming out but then it never happened then they moved to constant stories about iPhones breaking or exploding or whatever take down piece they could think of. Remember bend-gate? Remember antenna-gate? The list goes on. Didn’t change the fact that apple dominated the market.,12-02-2023,,

"I think there is a lot of institutional money out there still betting on them. ARKK being one of the biggest. Probably the same kind of people that lost a lot on the tech slide in Q3-Q4 2022, who need to put up some big numbers in Q1 2023 to stop the bleeding of people taking their assets elsewhere. In that way it can be seen as a sort of self-induced pump. Tesla knows they can burn some of their profit margin advantage to pump up sales figures. This probably helps them with market share at a crucial period of wavering public opinion, and definitely props the stock back up. Maybe it's being done in conjunction with investment interests. Or maybe Musk is just hoping for one more good selling opportunity so he can pull out enough money to fund Twitter and SpaceX for another decade. Either way, I think the smart money has figured out by now that Tesla is not going to attain 50% of the global auto market share within the next 5 years, as their valuation implies. But they might survive as a pretty healthy niche product, as long as they continue to drive innovation. Releasing a badass cybertruck and world-beating roadster would be exactly the halo vehicles they need to cement their reputation as a real player. If the reality is we never see those Halo cars, and they instead are content to just make the same handful of products for 10+ years without major updates, the stock price has to get a reality check at some point. If that is their future, then they've got at least 75% to fall from current prices, maybe 90%. But Tesla fans are pretty entrenched. That's why it's tough to bet against.

"yes, that's exactly it. tesla actually adjusts its pricing pretty often to juice margins and maintain a healthy backlog, but demand versus production collapsed so dramatically last year that they had no choice but to cut really fast. model Y is backlogged so inventory is effectively zero, generally vehicles end up as inventory when a customer refuses delivery after it's already arrived at its destination or when tesla makes too much of a particular trim (they are made in batches which means some are not necessarily matched to an order on production). at the moment, there is enough demand that these vehicles get snapped up pretty fast, so low inventory + long delivery estimate = things going really well. by contrast, things do *not* appear to be going nearly as well for the model 3. model y demand has been stimulated really well by what was effectively two price cuts in a row, but i think this is probably offset by model 3's underperformance. there is essentially no backlog for model 3 and plenty of these cars are available. tesla probably cannot afford another significant price cut on the model 3 without losing money on them, so this will probably be a dark cloud over q1.",12-02-2023,,

"Exactly - this is just pulling and pushing demand around. It’s not a trend. Wait for Q1 to see how the trend is continuing before making assumptions. The legacy automakers know all the tricks - incentives, deals, dealer gimmicks, channel stuffing. Tesla is discovering tricks the rest of the industry has known about for 75+ years in some cases. The problem becomes when consumers start basing their activity based on traditional Auto industry stuff. If/when that happens Tesla gets another step closer to the median. Lots of legacy buyers time their activity to annual sales or new models. Hence the endless parade of “once a year deals”.

"> I don’t have Honda’s unit profitability data, so perhaps you can check that too if you’d like, but for example: in Q3 22 Tesla had over $9k net profit per vehicle You and everyone else is pointing to the same number. I feel like it should be self-evident and doesn't even need to be explained, but if you expect Tesla to become provider of a significant percentage of the cars purchase in the world, they won't be able to maintain anything close to this profit per vehicle. Tesla is essentially a luxury car manufacturer at the moment, and accordingly, they enjoy the profit margins of a luxury car brand. This works fine when you're a 2% of the market in niche brand. But There's simply no scenario on the planet where half of the car is sold in the country or the world are going to be luxury vehicles. If you're simply looking at this number and extrapolating from that under the assumption that they can continue to maintain that level of profitability per vehicle, you've made a huge miscalculation.",12-02-2023,,
"Profit per vehicle on a luxury car brand? That's perfectly relevant information if you expect them to remain a luxury car brand. But if you expect them to remain a luxury car brand, then they're going to only be able to sell to the niche part of the market that buys luxury cars. You can't have it both ways. You can't have Tesla as a company that has 10% or more of the car market and still manages to sell things at a profit margin commensurate with a luxury car brand. It's one or the other, Bub. Also, all this inventory they just sold was at a $7500 discount from their usual profit margin, so by my math that means they're only making $1,500 a car at the moment. Tesla can pivot to selling things at non-luxury prices and capture a significant percentage of the market, or they can continue to be a niche brand that sells at luxury prices. They can't have it both ways. They're simply isn't enough money in car buyers pockets to have it both ways",12-02-2023,,
Ok. So if they were going to compete they must be massively shifting now to be ready in time. Doesn’t seem to be happening quickly enough. By the time they are Tesla will be a cash cow producing millions more cars per year than they do now.,12-02-2023,,
"But you understand that this is in the context of hearing for 12 years that the tesla killer is coming next year, right? In 2012 it was only the rabid tesla fans who were saying that the competition was more than a decade behind. And now you are saying “yes, Tesla-gang was right all along, it took more than a decade to catch up. But THIS time it’s real.” Maybe. I don’t see a viable 2023 electric for my needs though, except tesla.",12-02-2023,,

"Sure, young and single folks might still be doing road trips and have only 1 car too, etc. But with 1.8 cars per household in US, once you remove 0 car households you're at 2 on average. So the median car in the US is in a household that has a 2nd vehicle to drive as an alternative. EVs won't work for many of our 1 car 1 person households even with networks (and some 2+ car households), because they are renters and can't install a charger. Or have only street parking. Long distance driving is a small concern vs not being able to ""fill up"" at home.",12-02-2023,,

"Look at his other positions; he's not doing well with those. Tesla was heavily oversold, the swing up was brutally quick (as was the dive down). Calls are pretty easy to start with, that is, fairly easy to understand. Don't treat them like a lottery ticket, read about pricing models and Greeks and off you pop. These mofos are using most, if not all their balance, so you have to have a high risk tolerance. I'm not sure this fits your last statement. Personally, I like to hit small and often with cash secured puts. I played those during the tesla swing, made about 8k, but it's limiting on the upside with the downside of having to buy the shares at what could be a shit price. The tesla thing was fairly obvious, it's getting the time right that's hard - or lucky. That 8k gain is about 0.075% of my wealth, a couple of those a month pays bills etc with the bulk of growth coming from boring stuff (etf etc) - I say this to give you an example of risk tolerance. Or money making money. Works till it doesn't.",15-02-2023,211.7599945,214.2400055

"In a perfect market, sure. But in reality the market makes mistakes all the time. You can even find huge mistakes with things like calendar spreads, when volatility is really high. Every single day you can find trades where your max loss is around 5% of your bet. And the odds of that are around 10%. And you have a 50% chance of making 100% profit and a 40% chance of making around a 300% profit. &#x200B; If I could sum up my biggest gift/skill set, it's looking at numbers and finding anomalies. And I've spent years and years trying to find flaws in the options market, believing they MUST be there somewhere. I finally figured it out. And I pinky promise it's VERY fucking flawed. Most the flaws are doing exactly what I said up there. Calendar spreads under certain circumstances.

"Yeah fuck green energy. More oil please. I want cheaper gas. Fuck the third world, I’ll be fine. But on a serious note, “ In conclusion, this report suggests that replacing the existing fossil fuel powered system (oil, gas, and coal), using renewable technologies, such as solar panels or wind turbines, will not be possible for the entire global human population. There is simply just not enough time, nor resources to do this by the current target set by the World’s most influential nations. What may be required, therefore, is a significant reduction of societal demand for all resources, of all kinds. This implies a very different social contract and a radically different system of governance to what is in place today. Inevitably, this leads to the conclusion that the existing renewable energy sectors and the EV technology systems are merely steppingstones to something else, rather than the final solution. It is recommended that some thought be given to this and what that something else might be.” This changes nothing, yes governments are not taking the scale of what’s needed seriously.

Why? >Just my opinion thought, would like to know your perspective. Yes it is your opinion. The EV market is miniscule compared to ICE vehicles. Less than 1% of cars on the road are EVs. The percentage of new sales for EVs is growing but the market is still very young. It's very simple: The more accessible it is to own an EV is the more people will buy them the more TSLA will sell. It's still incredibly impractical for a lot of people to own an EV for a number of reasons. TSLA opted for luxury over practically bc the margins are higher in value added services and features. It's also an incredibly adaptive and fluid company for something it's size. Not to mention they're heavily involved in solar and battery tech. Tons of upside even if it's overvalued at current PE. They're not going to ever be the only option on the market but they'll do more in volume even if it's less in percentage and become more efficient as they do.",16-02-2023,210.7799988,202.0399933

"Well, no… maybe thats a benefit that came out of it, but Elon bought Twitter because he was forced to. He became the largest shareholder without announcing it, then inflated the price by announcing he would buy Twitter at twice the value. At the high value he cashed out as he had planned. What he didn’t plan for is that his bluff would get called and he was facing either market manipulation charges or actually purchasing Twitter. Considering the “funding secured” stunt he pulled in 2018, he would be getting much more than a slap on the wrist for the blantant market manipulation. So he bought twitter. He tried to weasel his way out of it too. He spread a lot of information that twitter falsified user numbers with bots - which, if actually true, would have given him a reason to drop the contract and keep his gains from his stock sale. But it seems as though his team was unable to provide sufficient backing to the claims",20-02-2023,,

Your instant noodles are not hand stretched noodles and therefore they are not classified as ramen. I'm aware that Korea has instant noodles labelled as ramen, which is an oddity. But Korea has stews in restaurants where they serve instant noodles instead of hand-made noodles, which may explain why they combine the term (it sounds nicer to tell your customer its ramen instead of instant noodles I guess.)

In South Korea, ramen refers almost exclusively to Japanese noodles with fresh ingredients and spices, usually served at restaurants. Meanwhile, ramyeon refers to instant noodles with dried vegetables and artificial flavoring. Ramyeon is served at eateries, too, but cooks use pre-packaged instant noodles.

"My dude, I'm sorry for your loss, but take this moment to learn. You shouldn't be risking 44 call contracts worth of money on anything if you can't afford to lose all of it. I learned this the hard way with only 5 contracts, and LEAPS at that (generally the safest bet), when the market started to tumble last year. Lost a lot on that and I feel awful about it. It was all I had besides the long stocks I own. So now you know, don't ever bet the whole savings/paycheck/checking account on a risky thing like options. Bet maybe 15%, and even then only when you understand the math involved fully and are confident that the stock is at a fair price (or an unfair price if going short). Other strategies exist. You should watch InTheMoney on YouTube. Adam explains everything really well and strategies. People like to say YOLO. They're absolutely full of shit. You Only Live Every Day Of Your Life. There are a million chances to correct this. And a million chances for the YOLO attitude to fuck it up. Be meticulous.",10-03-2023,175.1300049,173.4400024
Taking the loss is so hard but your account depends on it. This morning I was so frustrated because I entered spy puts yesterday and got wrecked in the morning bull breakout.

How to develop new features when people who understood the spaghetti code are gone ? Analogy : Imagine that your bank goes down and everyone is fired. Your bank account will still work for quite some time, so what were all those employees doing ?!! But one day, you try to withdraw some money and it doesn't work.

My first programming job paid $30k/yr. It took me 5 years to get to $100k/yr. Pretty much this. Elevated positions, inflated titles, etc. If your experience matches your title you're in a pretty good spot. Especially if you're from a former big tech. I think 200k+ is pretty fair for someone whose had 10+ years of experience in today's market. It's not like it's some easy job that didn't require an extensive education and skillset. If we compare salaries to other careers that required extensive education and experience, you're basically on the same tier as, investment bankers (analyst and quants), attorneys and doctors. I would say if people adjust their expectations back to pre-pandemic that's exactly where the market is, I don't think the market has changed all that much. 2020-2022 was an anomaly, because proving your worth kinda went out the window. I would say that things are normalized now. It doesn't matter how ""smart"" you are, if you're new and you don't have the experience you will have a tougher time proving your worth. I think the worst advice that people got between 2020-2022 was to stay in your lane. I feel like I've heard front end devs having the hardest time looking for a new job. Backends getting hired in no time. And in speaking to some, it really sound like managers pushed them to alleviate responsibilities and stick to the corporate structure they laid out. When in reality is you shouldn't ever stay complacent and learn and take on responsibilities because no one will blame you for wanted to learn and improve. You allowed yourself to be one dimension because that's what leadership wanted. When the market conditions changed, it seemed like front end devs had the hardest time with the transition. Most positions available today are either backend or full stack. Unless you're really talented and you learn fast, I feel like having 4-5 years of experience folks who managed to work their way to a senior position during the pandemic will need to accept a down level. I've seen staff level guys who need the job downleveling themselves into a senior position and there's enough of them out there that I think most low experience ""seniors"" are probably not even going to sniff an interview.

But he also discovered that even as the richest person, he’s nothing on the global scale. He gave Ukraine those Starling dishes, then talked to Putin (allegedly), turned the dishes off unless congress paid for it, then got called by Biden and turned them back on again.

I couldn’t tell you… Anyways, he was super good with computers and this was way before I developed an interest in them. Supposedly he got in trouble for a cyber crime and was sent to this placement facility where I met him. The reason I bring it up is because the kid was really smart and really stupid at the same time. He had areas in his life where he succeeded and others where he miserably failed. Elon Musk reminds me exactly of this kid. Musk is a smart engineer (apparently) but fails spectacularly when it comes to other things that are more social.

"> I wonder if junior engineers will pivot to other roles, start their own business or take pay cuts. This is actually what happened in 2008, and it kinda lead to rapid growth if new start ups that lead to these major companies we see today, Netflix Uber, FB, AirBnB, Square, Twitter, etc all saw their rapid rise because a shit ton of people lost their jobs, pivoted their career at the same time these companies desperately needed talent to expand. These people who got laid off are talented people and they'll find means to get by, but unfortunately in a typical business cycle experience does matter. It's accepting downlevels and openness to try a small smart up, or mid-tier company. These are the people that are hiring the most right now. But I still see a lot of folks who got laid off from a big tech only want to seek another big tech because of culture and amenities. It was good while it lasted, but a lot of them are treating it like they can't get over a break up. But going back to the inflated packages, a lot of that had to do with it being easier to dilute high share prices vs where the stock prices are now after some valuation correction. So I tell most people in tech that TC doesn't matter. I would seek the highest base pay, so when the market pivots you'll have a better opportunity elsewhere without worrying about RSUs especially if you're seeking a job today and you're getting your compensation package today. Because the cycle isn't over, we're a the very end of a traditional business cycle, and you don't really know if those RSUs would be worth anything after your 1 year cliff, you don't know if your stocks would be diluted, or if your company will see more corrections.

"Are you referring to media coverage of them? When I look at what any of them have done in their careers, I don’t see much difference between Democrat or Republican politicians, because our country is actually a Plutocracy ruled by the rich. Each President I’ve seen when I boil it down, did the same things in the interest of the plutocrats, not the American people. Yes Biden did more things in a liberal sense, but he allowed some things trump enacted or helped to enact as well as continued some of what trump started like with tariffs on China and trade related deals which I found perplexing. I’ve also found Biden’s blatant lack of responsibility for his administrations actions preposterous, he blames it on the last administration, while it may be a half truth, he should own it apologize and move on, instead he drags his own name through the mud instead by constantly blaming the other guy. As this is a plutocracy, and Trump didn’t like the other rich much, and he took on the massive corruption of inter agency embezzlement as well, I believe the reason why Trump was demonized was due to him attacking government and corporate intelligence agencies and mass media conglomerates on his first day(or so) in office(he declined to increase their funding and actually reduced it substantially), not anything to do with what he did specifically as President but more his personality to call people out on their BS when should have kept mouth shut on it, in other words he simply burned a bridge with broadcasters and intel community who are the ones that feed the media their propaganda(which not since WWII was it legal for state sponsored propaganda and Obama signed back into law allowing it again), this is also why Elon bought Twitter at a loss, to stop bias state sponsored censorship and propaganda. Elon is an independent that understands that if free speech is muzzled, the whole free world is closer to tyranny and damnation. [I would also wager had Trump not burned the bridges when he got in office, the media would have had a more rose tinted version of him and treated him the same as the other sellouts to the plutocrats and “mafioso” agencies. And almost nobody would have gotten so polarized for or against Trump.] Also, it was Micheal Flynn fomenting coup attempts by creating and guiding an ultra patriot group in America, he felt betrayed by his government that tried framing him, he created the military psyops “Q movement” in order to put pressure on the government that was coming after him legally. It was Flynn that suggested to Trump and 2 others in the room that he should cling to power and declare martial law. Source: Vice Trump never instigated violence, he only asked for protests, placing violence in there is putting words in his mouth which he never said. As well as pushes the false notion that the protests an the 6th were violent, in majority it wasn’t, in regards to the footage being released by McCarthy which shows the truth behind Democrat and Republican deception to gain more power over citizens that were well within their rights to protest, and the citizenry at large. Allowing injustice due to deception to continue only inches us all closer to a rhyming of Nazi germany. Never underestimate the power of propaganda, always remember what the news isn’t there for, your betterment, it’s not news anymore and hasn’t been for a long time.",27-03-2023,194.4199982,191.8099976

"Yeah, that's pretty much exactly it. The system I was using was similar but not the same. With the $1000 example, instead of 50% each way I tried to maintain $500 in Tesla (+/-8%) so if it dropped to $400 I'd buy $100, basically doubles whatever you'd buy and sell to maintain 50%, but only your cash balance increases which is great if you're drawing a wage from it. You do make more that way, but it has the potential to wreck you if it drops 75% or more like it did. That's why I suggest 50% cash, rather than a fixed amount of share value.

"I agree that the valuation is high, for a car company, but Tesla has income streams that are already up and running in software, energy(megapacks), and electricity(chargers). Look at the total sales of those car companies you listed. Look at total units sold 3 years ago vs last year, or their own projections for this year. Notice how all of them have shrinking unit volume, and sales projections? Tesla sold 499k units in 2020, and sold 422k units in the last 3 months. ""still relatively small"" They have the worlds highest volume car for 2023 sales. They will almost guarantied sell more vehicles than ford next year, and just as many units this year. Luxury prices? The model s plaid is 100k for a car that has no competitors anywhere near that price. The model 3 can be had for around 40k after the rebates, and that is the best value of any ev available. The new ev6 gt is 20k$ more for 2/3rds of the range. Do you use FSD and hate it? I have found it to be very impressive personally, but I know that its not perfect yet. I believe that 5 years from now, they will sell enough software and electricity to make the valuation make plenty of sense. They currently have 0 debt and innovate constantly, while pocketing billions in profit. I agree to disagree with you on certain things.

"Tesla's objective is to be able to make cars that everybody (well not actually everybody but you get the idea) can afford to buy. They have noted their prices have long been too expensive. So continued price cuts as conditions warrant or demand it is to be expected. The question is what impact do these have on margins. This is difficult to guess at as it often starts with the assumption that the cost for Tesla to build a car has not declined by a corresponding amount. Also, we have little insight into whether Tesla is in the process of a change that will cut costs in the near future allowing them to cut prices now at a hit to margins only to see those margins go back up as upcoming cost savings are factored in. Regarding comparing Tesla to others here... Tesla is very profitable and can afford to move these numbers as they determine necessary. The others are losing money on EV's and any cut to prices will mean their losses increase and risk their efforts.",19-04-2023,179.1000061,180.5899963
It would be faster to buy a new Tesla. Than wait for an appointment to actually get a service appointment to fix your current Tesla. That is the main flaw of Tesla’s zero dealership model. Tesla has too many things going on the same time. You’ll have to suck it up as customer since you don’t have no other recourse. Since Tesla controls everything. The traditional dealership model isn’t perfect. But this allows carmakers to focus on designing and building better cars. Without getting burdened by customer service support. Since you have dealerships outsourced to handle consumer sales and maintenance service. If you are unhappy with how your dealership treats you as a customer. You can go to another dealership. Or get you car serviced by an independent garage. With Tesla you can’t even do that. Tesla knows and controls everything that goes on with your car. Tesla can even disable features remotely.,19-04-2023,179.1000061,180.5899963

This was me in January when they dropped the prices. MYP and M3P are both completely insane by normal car standards and the price makes it very hard to find anything that is comparable in terms of bang/buck. I personally agree but I think the bloodbath will ultimately be much more extensive. Tesla ramping up production volume and dropping prices (especially if they release a sub-30k car) is going to absolutely hollow out the balance sheets of a lot of companies. Pretty much the only part of the market that Tesla isn't taking a huge bite out of is cheap/economy cars and work trucks... and both of those are coming next.,19-04-2023,179.1000061,180.5899963

You’re missing the point entirely. Tesla stock is way overvalued on the premise they’ll continue to grow unit volume at 50% compounding while maintaining their profit margins. If they have to slash prices to drive demand that changes the investment thesis. The share price will have to come down to reflect the reality of margin compression and reduction in expected future earnings. Of course if you keep slashing prices on a product you can get people to buy it. You just don’t make as much money off each sale. Top line growth and unit volume growth without earnings growth is meaningless.,19-04-2023,179.1000061,180.5899963

No. Tesla Model Y only has to be under 80k to qualify for the tax credit. Model 3 only has to be under 55k. They’re far below it already and didn’t need to cut at all to qualify.,19-04-2023,179.1000061,180.5899963
"It's possible they are just front running projected savings now that supply chains are cooling off. Would take some time to realize that difference, but the short term hit to margin is likely worth it, especially if they can gain market share and general demand through the recession. Added bonus is this lights a few fires under old auto as well. One thing no one wants to talk about is that tesla likely never intended for 25%+ margins to begin with. When demand leapfroged production, they had to controll the frenzy with overpricing. Had the growth in demand been more steady, we likely never would have seen the high prices of the Last 1-2 years. Now that production is catching up, they can return to the prices they had always intended.",19-04-2023,179.1000061,180.5899963

Autonomous Fleets - This is even more horse shit. Elon promised people back in ? 2018 ? that their cars would make them money while they slept. How he isn't in a jail cell, like Trevor Milton, is beyond me. These cars are nowhere close to this and may never be. It is 2023 and even their latest versions of FSD are not even remotely close to Level 5. (they are Level 2) Solar Charging - Their solar business has done jack & shit since he acquired his relative's company, Solar City. As far as demand/production, they are especially screwed. They keep adding factories/output while sales have plateaued. They have no choice but to cut costs to move all of the cars they are making. Expect much further margin pain.

"That's like saying supercruise is more advanced compared to fsd because you don't need to hold the steering wheel. Except for the fact that you can only use supercruise on certain parts of a highway and has a minimum speed - try using it on city streets, it's basic af. Doesn't know shit That's like me saying my algorithm can solve a maze, but only these specific mazes. Nothing outside what I've programmed. With waymo and fsd, waymo has overfitted where it can drive, but outside of it's training data set, it's probably useless (which is why it's still geofenced). FSD is taking on the generalized approach, which is the way you want to approach AI. AI is meant to solve for hard generalized problems. Problems you cant solve with normal programming. With Waymos geofence, you could probably brute force a normal algorithm to work for Chandler Arizona, but it won't help you anywhere else. The whole point of using AI is to throw data at it to solve your entire problem (not just a subset of your problem), and then see how it goes and iterate. If you only solve for a subset of your problem (and I don't mean just use a subset of your data for training), you are essentially building the architecture for your AI to sub for that city (or area) only. If you want to expand, you are basically going to start from scratch again. The architecture you used for that model isn't going to work. That being said. I'm not saying Waymo is behind Tesla. Tesla also has to find their local minima, and then re-architect to improve to find a new local minima. With Tesla's approach though, you can see a generalized improvement, while Waymo could have 1 city, 2 cities and then add more and more and also see improvements that way. Anyways, the point is, the distance with Tesla and Waymo is not very easy to see... But if you look at their training methods, it's pretty easy to say which one has an advantage. Tesla has people paying for the vehicles, and then also paying for FSD. It doesn't stop there though. They even have people driving FSD, and providing feedback. They're basically free employees (actually they pay Tesla). While Waymo has to buy off the shelf expensive cars, and then modify them. Waymo at least now has people paying them for the taxi service, but the amount of data they get vs Tesla is peanuts. Data is everything for training a network.",19-04-2023,179.1000061,180.5899963

Don’t be so sure. I worked in a similar industry that only sold product through dealer networks. The dealer is who deals with the customer and takes all of their bullshit. Going direct removes that insulation between the customer and the manufacturer. I guess time will tell how that plays out. I’ve heard a mixed bag from Tesla service.

"Speaking as a 'casual' truck owner, I'll say that functionality is still very important.

The fact is that the vast majority of truck owners still use the bed enough of the time to make it worthwhile. For me, not being able to reach over the side of the bed to adjust straps or rearrange things after you've loaded them is a real dealbreaker. It's just a pain to get in and out of the bed to do simple stuff, especially if you're older or overweight. And while not all trucks are work trucks, the fact that they *can* be adds tremendously to their value. A 20 year old beat up Ford Escort isn't worth hardly anything.

"The PT Cruiser was more like the start of that retro trend with the fwd Beetle, S197 Mustang and MINI. The Cybertruck is different though despite the looks. What draws me to it: Design isn’t constrained by an ICE drivetrain (or even trying to look like it has an ICE drivetrain). So if fits a quad cab with 6.5’ in the same size as a quad cab with 5.5’ bed truck. The R1T is fine, but it still looks like a Tacoma with “futuristic” lights rather than maximizing space for occupants and cargo - although I love the gear tunnel concept, and if the bed was 6.5’, I’d have gone for it. Design has material constraints, using thick stainless steel for the body means it can’t be pressed like regular steel, but with the gigacastings and hopefully structural battery, the stainless body panels will be strong enough as the unibody. Not needing to be painted too should mean it’s cheaper to build after the investments in machinery is paid for. 6.5’ bed, I should be able to load my motorbike on the bed - perhaps at an angle if necessary - and close the tailgate. If the production version includes an integrated ramp, it’ll be pretty much exactly what I want. Supercharger network. Also, whilst they are taking way too long to bring it to market, perhaps that’s a good thing for the features of the truck and supply chain. I hate that the Model Y is $10k less than when I bought mine, but it also gives me a bit of optimism that the dual motor cybertruck will be nearer the $50k price point they quoted when I put down my reservation.",22-04-2023,,

I’d like to be able to use an electric truck for family vacations though and other road-tripping, and Tesla recently announced that CT and Semi will be compatible with a new megawatt charger. Although pricing isn’t official anymore, I’m currently assuming that the price/range ratio of the CT is going to absolutely dominate Rivian and Ford, but maybe not. I’m interested in range, price, and charging network. I think Tesla currently brings the most value there, but we’ll see when (if) it launches.

Some cool features of the cybertruck I think are worth noting. Built in ramps into tailgate, seamless transition from bed to down tailgate (no more picking mulch gravel dirt from the crack), flat bed with no wheel well bumps. Stainless steel bed. Sliding truck bed cover with lock. Rear tires that can turn slightly as well, offering tight turning radius. A larger cabin and larger truck bed compared to Ford GMC etc, while a similar vehicle footprint. Able to driver through deep water for short distances. It's okay to hate the design, but a lot of the truck has good innovations that can't be discredited. Having to lug ramps around whenever I need to use them is a pain in the ass, and always bothered me, like, there can't be some sort of alternative to this?

Yea all the other car companies have everything Tesla has and superb quality and trustworthy dealers. I love going on road trips in my Chevy Bolt which only had its battery recalled and using GM’s Supercharger network which can get me anywhere in the US - there isn’t 50 miles of interstate without it! I also love the driver assistance that comes standard and the 5 star safety rating in every category and subcategory whereas Tesla definitely isn’t the safest car on the road. I also love the security system and dashcam that comes standard on my Mustang Mach-E and that I can order the car on my phone and pick it up without any hassle. My kids also are amazed by our Ioniq 5’s video games and video streaming for when we’re charging!

"I’ve heard this argument a lot in the past but every Tesla owner I talk to seems to say the opposite, at least in recent times. Multiple of my buddies have said they’ve driven 50-100k miles with 0 maintenance besides tires and brakes. Not many gas cars can compare to that besides likes of Hondas and Toyata’s, which are still priced at like 30K these days. And with the recent price cuts + credits, Tesla seems more attractive than ever compared to the competition imo Edit: I’m not saying Tesla should be $2000 but their build quality has gotten better and maintenance costs are well below or at par with other cars. And there’s no other car that offers the same level of comfort and performance at that price point, simple as that.",24-04-2023,164.6499939,162.5500031

"The group think/delusional mental illness is a real thing. My core friend group has all been very close since high school (we're in our 30s now). One of our friends was an early-ish investor into tesla (with inheritance from his grandma). He was a traveling surfer stoner type who never cared much about anything besides surf, girls and travel and never had a real job. Well, when Tesla started to take off after the covid crash, he started to make good money, and started to spend *a lot* of time watching tesla videos, reading tesla articles, following tesla twitter, etc. He doesn't have a job so, I'm talking full time just watching bullish tesla youtubers rave about elon and tesla. This friend doesn't really surf anymore, barely travels, and at this point tesla makes up 90% of his personality. We all agree that tesla probably has a bright future, but this friend very honestly believes that Tesla will eventually replace all global governments when they start issuing UBI after monopolizing most industries on earth. Because of the way mainstream media was so against tesla on its 10x run, this friend now has this ""us against the world"" mindset, as in, us normal people just can't see the vision like him and all the other Elon stans, and we're all going to miss out if we don't invest 100% of our net worth into this company. He was up I think around 2m at the peak, but has lost over 75% of it, and has never sold a single share (after a 20x gain on a lot of his investment at the peak) because why would he sell when it's guaranteed to 10x again in a few years and then again a few years later. When you argue with him, he generally just spits out word for word quotes from youtubers, cathie, etc. You can go on twitter or reddit and theres literally thousands of people saying the exact same shit he says, word for word, regurgitating some smart sounding quote from cathie or a tesla youtuber. If you question him, he has to pull up more tweets and quotes on his phone that he can't recite off the top of his head, and if you back him into a corner, he just defers to the ""experts"" and sends you some hour long youtube video. It's been crazy to watch him completely lose himself to the tesla cult. It's taken over his entire personality. I've never witnessed anything like it.",24-04-2023,164.6499939,162.5500031

I can definitely imagine how it goes for a lot of these little shops. They're doing respectable revenue and one day they get the opportunity for an automotive contract that'll quadruple their revenue in two years. They're naive so they don't realize they're selling their god damned souls and squandering the good thing they got going, so they agree. They borrow five years of current state profit for new capital equipment to meet the demand, and just like that they're fucking trapped. They can't say no to new contracts because they'll immediately go bankrupt from the tax burden of the otherwise unnecessary machines alone.

"For 2027? I think $1000 is pretty reasonable. Products that will be in mass production by then: next gen $30k vehicle, possibly robotaxi, Cybertruck, megapacks. 'Solved' FSD is worth $1T+. If you are watching the pace of AI advancement, you'd realize that FSD is an absolute certainty at this point. They'll have FSD full approval and a robotaxi, although they probably won't have more than 2/3M on the road by then at the most. However once FSD is solved, that will be a very large catalyst that will push the stock an easy $1/$2T higher. You also have to keep in mind their energy division which is growing faster than their auto division. Honestly $2000 isn't that crazy if you actually think about the market value of FSD alone. I won't be surprised when a company like Ford just decides to license FSD when it's ready. If they're half smart they'll do it. Even without FSD, there will be a time period around 2025/2026 when their costs will go down substantially due to mass production of their own batteries AND refining domestically. When Tesla says they can build their next gen car for half the cost of the Model 3 - believe them. Tesla will probably have the largest market cap in the world by 2025/2026 even without FSD.",24-04-2023,164.6499939,162.5500031

In the bird model, we are unsure of the total number of birds. In the Tesla model, we know precisely how many have been produced. Either way, it is not safe for you to postulate that all crows are white because you have no evidence of how many crows exist. Only that you’ve observed several, and those several are all you’ve observed.

Then the next comment saying it's a piece of shit with issues no other car manufacturer has. This is going to roll on and on and till something significant happens with Tesla. I'm short on Tesla btw.

"Quality is not ""seen"", it's measured and tracked. I worked in automotive QA for ten years doing precisely that lol.

You can have bad design with high quality, but you can't have it backwards. You can't have a reliable car with bad quality.",24-04-2023,164.6499939,162.5500031

"Yeah true loosing 100 dollar is no big deal, my major losses are in stocks that were considered ""solid"" two years ago but have since tanked. Down 6k on one stock and 3k on another :) , also had succeses but those two hurt. My meme stocks bets have funnily outperformed my ""safe defensive"" stocks. If you are wondering my defensive stocks were mostly in food(indoor growing). Because of the war in Ukraine and the rising energy prices(mostly gas) most of those stocks got completely destroyed and some even hit bankruptcy. My loss porn is about a small cars worth in total. Not terrible compared to some others but of course it does kinda suck.

My reason was stated. I think there's a general lack of space exploration and one billionaire spends his money on it. There are thousands of billionaires. There's 6 people can name. The worst ones aren't in that 6. I think Elon is bait to make the general populace be outraged against a target that has no effect on fixing our corrupt political and economic systems. It's a distraction. And it's an odd psychological phenomenon that people can't see it and almost seek it out. It seems a lot of people are addicted to outrage dopamine in their social media usage.

That's of course huge growth for Tesla, and obviously they have the capital for still more massive expansion, so it's not out of the question that they pass BMW and Mercedes in 4 or 5 years, but they are still a very long way to go to actually achieve that scale, and a lot of ways they could seriously stumble. They have the cash to play in the big leagues with Toyota and VW group, if they can deliver. The problem is that Tesla is growing into a valuation. BMW, Hyundai and VW group are all trading at PE ratios under 4, and GM is under 5. Tesla is at 44. They need to grow to meet their valuation or they're going to suffer hard. Now granted, they are very profitable per car, but scaling up will come with its own costs and risks.",15-05-2023,167.6600037,166.3500061

"For most people I know, sex and masturbation are not the same thing. Most people in this thread are conflating the two. A sex robot will never replicate the back and forth between a human during sex. If you view sex as just a means to reach orgasm regardless of your partner, then respectfully, I feel bad.

Are some people going to pay 10k to have a better time masturbating? Sure. But again, I really don’t think it will impact Tesla’s bottom line if it were real.

"You’d have to do the research and find out how large the sexless population really is. I remember this being an issue in Japan so I’m going to use them as an example. “The number of single people has reached a record high. A survey in 2011 found that 61% of unmarried men and 49% of women aged 18-34 were not in any kind of romantic relationship, a rise of almost 10% from five years earlier.” “Around 42 percent of the men and 44.2 percent of the women admitted they were virgins.” So there are 42% of Japanese men in that age group must be at least a couple of million potential customers. How many of these you could convert to actual sales I don’t know. There’s the argument with rising house costs and living expenses that people fear they will never be able to afford a family and a house etc: “""It's too troublesome,"" says Kishino, when I ask why he's not interested in having a girlfriend. ""I don't earn a huge salary to go on dates and I don't want the responsibility of a woman hoping it might lead to marriage."" Japan's media, which has a name for every social kink, refers to men like Kishino as ""herbivores"" or soshoku danshi (literally, ""grass-eating men""). Kishino says he doesn't mind the label because it's become so commonplace. He defines it as ""a heterosexual man for whom relationships and sex are unimportant"".” Found this on the same article which is weirdly relevant: “Aoyama cites one man in his early 30s, a virgin, who can't get sexually aroused unless he watches female robots on a game similar to Power Rangers.” Personally I’m inclined to agree with you. It won’t ever be as big a business as cars. It could definitely be a solid revenue stream though.",18-05-2023,174.2200012,176.8899994

"I’d add that merely looking at the sexless population would be insufficient, especially if these sex robots are only female. Assuming the latter, we’d have to take the sexless market, subtract the homosexual population, subtract the asexual population, subtract the low income population, subtract those with disabilities preventing them from having sex, subtract the population who are trying but failing to meet people etc. You also have to consider the social stigma inherent to owning a multi-thousand dollar sex bot. A lot of people might be embarrassed to have one, or purchase one. That could change over time but the stigma exists today. What you’re left with is going to be pretty limited imo. Could that industry grow to be in the billions? Probably. Could it grow to be in the trillions? Almost certainly not imo.",18-05-2023,174.2200012,176.8899994

So when a bunch of stuffy government surveyors ask teenagers if they’ve had “sexual intercourse” the answer is, like all teenager throughout time, “giggle giggle they said intercourse. Uh, no I haven’t had ‘sexual intercourse.’” They interpret the question literally and give the literal answer.

"Yeah but ugly single women over 50 automatically get promoted into Carens or Catlady so we already have them sorted. Incles are just a whole nother level. Man mental health is a big topic but basically blaming everything on one side is stupid. Incel logic is ""my life is shitty cause i don't get laid"" meanwhile the actual logical chain is ""you don't get laid cause your life sucks"" and they basically then blame everything towards not getting laid as the reason be it their shitty job or whatever. They are basically the male version of third and fourth wave feminists who blame everything on men. ""My jobs sucks its mens fault"", ""i cant pay my rent cause i am a recless soender its the evil man"", ""i hurt my toe this morning because a evil man sold me the nightstand"" and so on. Both of these groups aren't taken seriously only the feminist got a better media standing that's all. But in their core believes these two groups are the same thing. Take some incles stuff and replace any term for women with man and it reads like from a feminist collective. And if you replace it with jews it reads like something from Hitler.",18-05-2023,174.2200012,176.8899994

"I'd be curious if you fed a few million lines of only fans chats into chatgpt then put that chat behind an attractive model, would it be convincing enough for people to think it's real? Granted, customers on OF have tricked themselves into thinking they are getting genuine human interaction the same way some people at a strip club think they have a chance with the stripper. Everyone outside knows that the OF model/stripper has no genuine affection towards a customer, but they're paid to pretend otherwise. I guess I'm wondering where the people that pay into those industries draw the line. They would know the sexbot 5000 is a robot with no genuine feelings, but if it looks, talks, or fucks the way they want... Would they care that it's completely manufactured? Basically, I don't think customers of OF, strip clubs, or prostitute necessarily care about genuine human connection, as much as they care about perceived connection. If a robot maker gets ""close enough"", I bet that works for a lot of people in that market. Would they rather have a real person telling them fake things over the Internet, or with the rules of a strip club, or would they prefer a robot that they can physically touch/interact with and *acts* real even though a part of them knows it isn't. Also introduces some cyber-brothel business options. Prostitution is illegal in most states, but I doubt there are any laws prohibiting renting out a life-like sex toy. I agree with whoever above me said they wouldn't sink 50% of their portfolio into this kind of business, but I could definitely see myself taking a 5-10% position if a company creates a model that doesn't live in the uncanny valley.",18-05-2023,174.2200012,176.8899994

OP should immediately shrink all position sizes to 1/10th their value and try to gain $400 per day instead of $4000. Or even smaller. All it’s gonna take is one bad move and a $4k-$7k loss to put him on tilt, get him emotional and revenge trading, or holding and hoping a complete loser that destroys 2/3 his account value in one trade He should instead be focusing on increasing his win rate and profit factor with smaller amounts that won’t kill him if he has a few bad trades After all.. you were making $14.50/hr before this… why not aim for $200 per day trading and stop risking so much?

He decided he was now a professional poker player and bought a seat at the World Series of Poker. Within 6 months all that money was gone. The worst part was he bailed on all his classes that semester and he didn't even bother to pay off his student loans.

Rivian is probably not doing as bad as the stocks. I see Rivian truck in Rhode Island quite a lot.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939

Rivian still has a shot at success.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
"I do like Polestar, beautiful designed car . I think they will do well with sales long term. And was going to buy one next year actually !",15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
I see 2-3 Rivians a week and they're really impressive. You would assume at some point someone buys them. That and Lucid are the only ones on this list I would consider buying as the Saudi's have infinite money and want a federal car company.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
So you are saying there is hope for Fisker?,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939

TSLA is still -60% from its high too…… Edit: sorry TSLA is currently -38% from its high of $414.50. TSLA was -60% only 30 days ago.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
What about all the traditional car makers? I did a count last week and from what I saw on the roads and parking lots about 10-15 % of the EVs are Tesla now. (Norway) There are just too many good alternatives to Tesla for the stock to be priced as high as it is now.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
I do like NIOs battery swap ideas though. I’d 100% get a Tesla if they did the same concept. Taking only 2 minutes (and less as they keep improving the speed) to get a full charge,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
"Tesla killers (or rather, competitors) are the historical auto makers. People are gonna choose between a Model whatever and the equivalent BMW, Ford, Mercedes, Porsche, Nissan, Stellantis etc equivalent. People way overestimate the moat you can get in electric cars, this is not the internal combustion engines era, you don't get such a moat in electrical automotive.",15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
I'm going to go invest in fisker. I don't give a shit about the EVs but they've had some really beautiful cars. That's the kind of investment that I don't care if it makes money because I just want them to stay alive. When a company is also a starving artist you become their family that gives the money to stay alive.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
"The Tesla killer will be Toyota, not these venture companies.",15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
Got a big stake in fisker and i am not worried. Its a risky investment but could also turn out Great. I bought when it was really low so im up 20%. If i was down 80% i might be worried,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
Real Tesla killer is Musk,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
"It's going to be hilarious in 2025 when tesla isn't selling 20 million cars a year like they're projecting and Tesla bulls wonder what went wrong and who sold them the pipedream. I'll be amazed if they even release the cybertruck by then. No doubt FSD still won't be a feature but musk will say ""probably by year end"" and then sell more stock. Edit 2030 is the year but they still won't do it. Bulls are coping hard.",15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
Proterra makes buses so I’m not sure anyone ever thought of them as a Tesla killer,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
Rivian and Fisker aren't dead.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939

Should I buy the dip?,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
Tesla fans are too insecure. They think any competition is out there to kill them.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
"i have faith in fisker. they’ll never be as big or good as tesla, but i think they’ll succeed",15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
Shorts thought they were a Tesla killer.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
See Rivians all the time around Philadelphia as well,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
"Yep, I think it may be time to invest in Rivian. They're just in stealth mode.",15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
"Rivn has <2 years to figure it out. They have $11B warchest (from Amazon), but burned $7B last year, and $5B the year before. The idea is you would sell more products to earn income to support operations, except their sequential sales are flat, and the unit economics are negative. If they sell more, they simply lose more money. They need a new injection of cash, or a sudden and gigantic ramp of sales with dropped production costs.",15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
And in CA. I'm betting on them making a comeback.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
They cost $150k to make and sell for $75k Hell of a deal,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
Are they are $14B company though? I've seen like 2 Rivians in my life,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
Yea people forget how Tesla started. They were a pile of shut company at first,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
But Nikola is gravity carmaker. It gets power from downhills,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939

"The Nikola subreddit is full of the most delusional people ever lol. Someone once commented that every part of the truck was done except for the engine. I asked them ""isn't that the most important part though??"" Instant ban lmao",15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939

"They just need a small cheep commuter vehicle. All of these companies are trying to sell to people that already have a Tesla. Start small start cheep, look at how Ford started make today's equivalent to the model A get cash coming in before you try to get the large price point.",15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
Polestar and Rivian are both great products,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
Yea Polestar are the only ev’s besides Tesla that I’ve seen near me (less random hyundais & other big names),15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
"Polestar is produced in China and, via Volvo owned by Geely (Chinese car manufacturer). While they try to brand it as Swedish, it's basically a Chinese car. Not sure that's so popular in the European/US-Market.",15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
Polestar and Fisker are the better quality EVs as well. You’d be much better off purchasing them over a Tesla tbh.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
"The thing people don't realize is that making 'an impressive vehicle' is not the most important thing. Scaling profitably is. Which Rivian might do, but might not. They have a lot working against them. They'll survive I think, but it will be a while before they make any money at all.",15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
Test drive one. They’re nice but the noise of the electric motors is much louder than a Tesla. It was weird and kinda annoying.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
"Just curious, how are Rivians impressive? I checked the pickup model out and thought it was mediocre and way overpriced. Was there something specific about it you liked?",15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
Yes but shares will be fucking diluted as hell. Being long on Lucid is fucking stupid at this point.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
Saudi owned 10% of cs and we know how that bank ended up,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
"Alot of it has to do with govt subsidies, carbon credits and push towards electrification.... even indirect things like $7500 federal tax credit helps tesla sell more cars. I am not saying elon should not be credited for teslas success, he clearly should..its commendable what he has done with tesla and spacex but it would be foolish to not accept that both tesla and spacex wouldn't exist today without govt subsidies/us taxpayers... same goes for nio and byd in china",15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939

And Elon,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
"other companies electric cars are getting better and better. You can get a Jaguar for about the same price as a Tesla which has the same or even better range and feels amazing to drive. It's still very much premium price, but the more companies are offering it the more affordable it seems to become. I wonder where the lowest price for a still viable product lies in a few years.",15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
Canoo is timing things perfectly. Will finally be ready for production just as everyone gets evicted and needs to live in a car.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
"Me too. I put $100 a month into their stock. If they fill all their pending van contracts and land the deal with the Army to supply pickups. They’re going to be a great investment. If they fail, it’s not going to kill me.",15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
The reason it isn't zero now is because suddenly they came up with several working trucks and have since made very unprofitable deliveries of those. Delivered more than 50 last year. They also still have a little bit of liquidity left. They'll likely survive the year and then let's see. It's a thin line they are walking because they'll run out of money very soon since they make losses and barely can raise capital due to the low stock price. Furthermore they have some assets left and intellectual property. The price won't become zero. If they become bankrupt someone will probably buy the scraps for a few hundred million.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939

BYD was founded earlier but the two companies entered the EV business in the same year. They were making batteries for consumer electronics before that. So it's fair to say that it's more like a peer to Tesla than a late entrant that would disrupt Tesla and an incumbent.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
"If you are using that as an excuse most of these listed businesses are fairly new whereas Tesla is almost 20 years old now. It's not a startup like those listed, it's a full fledged business. Every month Honda sells more ICE cars than EVs Tesla has sold in it's entire existence. Tesla bulls have always said Tesla would kill Legacy OEMs and Tesla bears have always said Legacy OEMs would prevail with it's conversion. The real risk to Tesla has always been Ford, GM, Korean OEMs, etc putting out mass market EVs. The reality is that there was mutual agreement that most of these companies IPO'd at high prices and honestly used borderline scam-like methods to IPO, however everyone was greedy and pumped it, nobody except for radicals and bag holders internally and honestly thought these businesses would kill Tesla, at least not in this time frame.",15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939
I think the issue there is someone who wants an eco box doesn't want to spend $40k+ on a car. That's why everyone is hitting the luxury market. EVs are still expensive to make.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939

"More than half of the world's EVs were sold in China last year. The reality is that outside of Tesla, nearly everyone who has experience manufacturing EVs at scale is Chinese. Even for Tesla, Tesla's sold in Europe are largely exported from the Shanghai factory and Tesla promoted the head of China to run global manufacturing. In that sense, taking a Chinese EV and slapping a European brand on it might be a winning strategy, since the ""Made in China"" brand is still pretty toxic in the west.",15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939

"I got to drive a Polestar 2 and the interior quality vs the Tesla Model 3s I've rode in is night and day. One feels like a proper interior for the price and the other does not.

"Interior quality/materials is top notch, design and usability is great, performance of the cars are solid, great on and off road capabilities, etc. They are the flagship models so of course they're going to be expensive.

The thing is… all of those subsidies and credits were available to all of the automakers. There was no ‘Tesla only’ category here. So it makes you wonder what the other guys have been doing relative to Tesla. Tesla ate their lunch on the credits because they were the only ones who actually did what the government was incentivizing companies to do. Established OEMS were basically paying Tesla so they could NOT do what the government was trying to accomplish by purchasing Tesla credits. The democrats who criticize Tesla for this I find amazing. I mean…. Did they not intend to incentivize electrification with their laws and regulations?

Anyone wanting to enter the BEV market has a ton of mistakes to make and learn from before they can enter the competition proper. VW ran into those issues and learned from them. Kia and Hyundai seem to be doing pretty good. Ford and GM still have mistakes to make and learn from. Audi, Mercedes, and other high end brand make good products, but they're expensive and they're not producing a lot. I don't see any real Tesla Killer^TM out there, I just see companies starting to enter the competition and facing Tesla s massive head start. The ICE side will finance the BEV side but if and when ice car sales get banned, ice won't pay for Bev anymore, and OEM's are going to be left with lots of stranded assets. They're going to have to pivot hard ahead of time to avoid those issues, and my personal take on it is that half of OEM's aren't taking it seriously or are too large and can't pivot as fast.

"Tesla sucks at building the outside of the car, with panel gaps and quality control issues. However, under the hood a BEV is radically different from an ICE car. It's not just a different kind of ice car, it's a completely different thing. You can't just say ""yes this company was great at making horse drawn carriages, they'll be able to make better cars than Ford can with their Model T"". Can other oems make good electric cars? Yes. Are they going to run into issues? Absolutely yes, look at VW and their whole software cluster fuck, and Ford's Mach E welding it's own battery. They can't just pivot on a dime and make great electric cars as though the ice expertise translates 100%. It doesn't. They have expertise in quality control and making a nice interiors, services and insurance and all that, and those absolutely plays a role. But none of that matters if what's under the hood is shit, and most manufacturers still have a ways to go to figure that shit out before they can mass manufacture. Tesla already figured all that out, their hurdle now is service, quality control, and not ruining their reputation more than they already have. Those are all serious issues, but at least they figured out the engineering, and under the hood they have a solid car that rolls very well, with good batteries and software. Figuring out the rest is difficult, but less difficult than engineering a whole new electric drive train, sourcing all new parts and supplies, mass manufacturing, and making it all profitable.

That’s no different from Tesla. Frankly when it comes to manufacturing you always tell your employees that you’re behind.

Government help that literally every single other automaker also had access to. This is like if I had 10 kids in a class and said “I’ll give you all $100 to try and run a successful lemonade stand” and 5 kids accept it and only 2 actually take it seriously. Then 6 months down the road one of those 2 kids is making $50/month selling lemonade and the other is making $500. If a parent walked up and said “oh yeah well they only made it because you gave them $100!” would that make any sense whatsoever? They were all offered it. Anyone could’ve taken it up. No one was stopped from taking the $100. Ill never understand why people think it’s a valid argument to constantly bring up “government subsidies” like every single other company wasn’t also offered the exact same deal. It’s such a pointless argument.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939

More Ev charging spots at malls would be fantastic. People are trying to take BEVs and think ""how can I try and use this car in the exact same way I used my ICE car"". It's a mistake because it's not the same thing, and in many ways BEVs can be better and more practical than ICE.

"Most if not all of what you said is factually and demonstrably wrong. Their cash on hand ($11B) was raised via their ipo, which was done at the absolute perfect time given the market conditions. The sole goal of an ipo is to RAISE MONEY thru equity offerings. By any corporate finance measure it was a smashing success. And they have enough liquidity to get them through at least 2026 via a mix of CoH, credit facilities, and their mixed shelf offering. Secondly, your statement about selling more products to earn income is the 100% wrong (and redundant tbh) way to look at it. Them increasing production means their FIXED COST ALLOCATION will be spread amongst more units and LOWER their cogs applied to each vehicle produced. So by definition them producing more means improved gross margins. Their unit economics are projected to be positive by the end of next year meaning hopefully positive operating cash flow. Your statement on if they sell more they lose more is flat out false. Plus add in in-house produced drivetrains and batteries plus renegotiated contracts, they are well on their way to being profitable.

Start by making expensive high profit margin cars that you only need to sell a few of and work your way down to being able to make a cheaper car that everyone can afford.,15-06-2023,248.3999939,255.8999939

"Companies *have to* lead with expensive models because those models’ margins are higher and they need to move fewer units to recoup the initial R&D costs. The cost to develop and manufacture a car doesn’t scale linearly with its MSRP, so if you’re needing to move 100,000 econoboxes to generate the same P/L as 10,000 luxury cars, you opt to develop the latter.

Tesla model 3 Bev sales eclipse all the oems, and when the sale of ICE cars gets banned the oems are going to be stuck with stranded assets. Of course oems have extremely aggressive goals. They don't have a choice. They catch up to Tesla or they die. It's bit like Tesla is sitting still either, they have a massive head start and are still pulling further ahead. I don't foresee any oem matching Tesla in sales volume in the next 5 years for sure, 10 years maybe. If anyone does I'm betting more on hyundai/Kia.

"I mean you're not wrong but I'm not really seeing good Bev's out of Japan. No good Honda Bev, no good Toyota Bev, no good Mazda Bev, not selling in large numbers with semi affordable prices. Gm has the bolt and its a good first shot, but they've done basically nothing with it except the bolt euv. Chevvy has the Volt, and they're working on catching up with their skateboard platform, and while I wish them luck they're still 10-15 years behind Tesla. Ford had their huge issues with the Mach E welding it's own battery, and hopefully they can make better cars in the future, but they're still behind Chevy in terms of BEV. European car makers seem to be doing better on the Bev front, with VW, Audi, and Mercedes making good vehicles. I haven't heard much complaints about them (except VW, they fucked up a lot and learned a lot from those mistakes), but they don't seem to have large numbers. Hyundai and Kia are doing good on the BEV front, and while I may be wrong they're possibly some of the more popular, cheap, and consumer friendly EVs out there. VW would have had this spot if not for diesel gate and software fuckups, but VW is catching up. And yet Tesla is still selling more EVs than any two non-chinese brand combined, and growing more BEV sales per year than any other OEM. The real threat to OEM has always been the ban on ice engines that will leave them with lots of stranded assets, and no way forward unless they massively invested in Bev's and sold at a loss to keep up with Tesla. I'm no Elon fanboy, but one has to realize that what Tesla and SpaceX did was pretty damn amazing in this day and age. Been hearing about how the ""real"" Tesla killer is just around the corner for 20 years now, it just doesn't seem like it's happening. Also I'm not really a huge car guy, and my info might be out of date, but if I'm wrong I would like to know! TL;DR doesn't matter how many ICE engines a company sells, if they have no idea how to make electric cars they're going to get fucked when gas car sales get banned.

"Experience making ICE cars doesn't mean squat when making BEVs though. Look at Ford's Mach e welding it's own battery. Look at the plethora of software issues plaguing early VW BEVs. Look at GM, and see they have a good car with the bolt and bolt euv, but they've done virtually nothing beyond those two somewhat compliance cars. It's like saying that experienced horse-drawn carriages can also produce great cars. Surethe outside might be similar, but virtually everything under the hood is different. Anyone going from ICE to BEV is going to make a lot of mistakes learning how to make BEVs properly. Tesla absolutely had and has issues with trim quality and service, those are huge issues Tesla needs to address sooner rather than later, but they are working on it, and dealing with that is simpler and less damaging to them than VW cars shutting themselves down on highways or Mach E's welding their own batteries. >>Plus, they'll be manufactured to a higher standard than Tesla for a similar price. > >This is the huge point, and really the larger problem facing Tesla - it isn't the startups that OP posted, it is legacy carmakers. It is Audi, Mercedes, BMW, Volvo, Lexus, Acura, etc. killing the S. It is VW, Ford, Toyota, Nissan, and Hyundai killing the 3 and the Y. It is the established car makers that have experience building high quality vehicles en mass who now have EVs hitting the market. I am not a huge car guy, and my info may be out of date, but IMHO it's vw, Volvo, Kia, and Hyundai that are going to be serious competition to Tesla. The others have Bev's that are either too expensive, sell/manufacture too few BEVs (compliance more than competition) or they just don't have good ev's to compare to Tesla.

You and me both. I knew a guy that had saved up the money for a MY when they were first coming out and the wait times were pretty beefy.

"This is not how the civilization works. I agree that debate between Elon and Mark would be rather boring, but violence isn’t the supreme authority. You can create society based on arguments, debates, compassion and good will. Society based on violence and jungle laws are not long lasting. People could not build something on the foundation of mistrust. For example police and army is build on concepts of honor, justice, freedom, in the past army was build on the foundation of the Bible or different ethical principles, religions or moral values etc. not on the principle of hate and violence at the core. Violence and hate was always the side product of human weaknesses and passions, and it always will be there for us. Therefore violence is the tool that is correct, and could not be underestimated or ignored, but it is not the foundation of our society or civilizations. This fight is super interesting for me, but this is indeed very immature and foolish. If Mark is the sportsman he should respect the rankings, and be guided by the fair play rules. MMA as a sport should not be used as a vengeance tool, or to settle who is right or wrong or as a emotional stress valve.

"BJJ only works if you can get your opponent on the ground. Elon probably has 60 pounds on him. If Elon gets some decent wrestling training. He could easily keep the fight standing and the BJJ means nothing. This fight will probably be a lot closer than what people here think. Fight will probably be short. Elon will either use his weight to dominate Zuck, or get tired by round 2 and Zuck takes over and wins.",23-06-2023,259.2900085,256.6000061

"""Some lessons"" are not going to be enough. A combination of total mat time and athleticism are what make the difference. It takes time to develop fight IQ and stamina, and Zuck has likely already put in hundreds of hours ahead of Elon and continues to put in more.

When they started their partnership, they incorporated and created hundreds of millions of shares which they split three ways. But now they’re ready for some money. First, maybe it’s an angel investor– a rich uncle, who gives them 100 grand in exchange for 5% of the stock they’re able to continue maybe even hire somebody if they get enough money. Now they have a pretty interesting looking product a year or so later. So they talk to venture capitalists and are looking for what’s called a series a seed round some VC loves their idea and gives them 1 million bucks in exchange for 10% of the shares. It continues like this for some while now the company’s been around for maybe 15 years. Maybe they have 1000 employees. They’ve done a few seed rounds and a bunch of different Veces have a bunch of their stock if they were smart, they kept as much of it for themselves as they could, anyway, this company might be valued up as as high is billions of dollars if you’re one of the special people an insider with tons of though you could have accumulated a bunch of their stock on the private market.

Apple produced 30B in net profit in Q1 compared to just 2.5B for Tesla. And Apple is maintaining their margins through challenging macro conditions.

Still doesn't make the business more valuable. Ask Toyota. 10M unit volume per year but lower margins due to the fact they sell insane volume of mass market vehicles with an average sales price of like $25k per car. Tesla is trying to transition from lower volume luxury prices to mass market. Their stated goal is 20M vehicles per year. That means their average sales price will continue to come down rapidly and their margins will continue to compress. That is the nature of high volume commodity vehicle sales.,02-07-2023,,
Disagree. The profit on vehicle sales is much higher than the profit on charging that same vehicle every once in awhile at a super charger. 80-90% of EV charging is done at home. And profit margins at charging stations are super low because you’re just a middle man buying energy from the utility company for the customer. There’s a reason Tesla didn’t get into building out charging infrastructure before the Biden incentives made it more economically viable for them.,02-07-2023,,

It can only be a choice to not know how many major gaps it has.

Servicing and charging cars is a low margin business. You can figure this out from Tesla financial statement (10-Q). For example in the latest quarter Tesla did 1.837B in Services revenue but cost of revenue was 1.702B. That means gross profit margin on services is only 7.9%.

"I don’t think FSD will ever be anything more than an L2 driver assistance package for a variety of technical and regulatory reasons. And regardless it will probably have a very low take rate because your average joe doesn’t have an extra $15k laying around. If the vast majority of your unit volume of 10-20M vehicles per year is $25-30k cars then you won’t be able to sell a high percentage with a nice to have like FSD. The only thing that matters in that price range is the cost for the basic utility of the car. Also, only a fraction of those cars will be sold in the US so the probability of FSD working in every country and being approved by every country’s regulatory body is very low so right off the bat that will destroy the take rate.",02-07-2023,,

Recent 50% run is nothing compared to the 100% run in Jan/Feb. (and it's done 100% 1-2 months runs in past years) The main reason it went from $300 to $100 between Sept and Dec 2022 was insider dumping (Elon said 'buy the dip' and then repeatedly dumped billions directly on the open market and through his foundation). The main reason it's gone from $100 to $250 in 2023 is continued execution / improving macro AND the LACK of insider dumping.,02-07-2023,,

Its self-driving software is not currently feasible. The only thing supporting it's share price is the bubble. It's a feedback loop. It being worth a lot just because it's popular is great until it's not. Once the world decides that it doesn't love the brand it will crash hard. I don't recommend shorting it because there's no way to predict when it will pop. Maybe not for many more years.

Yeah. If you're gonna shit on Cramer you should shit on his actual shit takes or when he's clearly shilling for his buddies and show guests. TSLA IPO for $17 (Charts won't show that now due to splits) in 2010 and was mid even up to May/2019. It was only after TSLA proved it wouldn't be bankrupted by the pandemic downturn and EV push came hard that it really took off. If you want to shit on Cramer you should find the one where he tells people not to buy TSLA in 2019 or 2022 lows. Unlike most regards on here I actually tried to do that. Results came back with him being [BULLISH on TSLA late 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXwilboQWvs). He's still wrong though since market AND TSLA were going to tank to shit in a few months.,03-07-2023,276.4899902,279.8200073

You can see this on articles, ""wait until this reaches this higher price before you buy... because it could indicate people are starting to buy in..."" i find Cramer jokes funny, but let's be real a) 10 years is too long a timeline, for which he has revised his opinions on and b) it would have been worse to tell people to pump a new company and then it turned out to be a dump.",03-07-2023,276.4899902,279.8200073

Now obviously, I have no way of knowing whether or not this is true. Would my family consider me a “snake oil seller” if I were to “only” be profiting $900k a year by the end of the 2020s? No. My take, is that he is trying to hold himself accountable. By telling the public of these aspirations, he is essentially allowing his investors/the public to hold him accountable as well. Believe it or not, but billionaires have some of the same struggles any other human has: staying focused, motivated, etc. Despite this, look at how far Elon/Tesla/his other companies have come in 10 years.

That hasn't been my experience at all. I got my Model 3 about the same time my wife got her Subaru and my mom got her Jeep. I don't know how much my mom has spent but it has spent weeks in the shop fixing issues. My wifes Subaru we have spent $4000 on 5 different repairs in the past 2 years. I have not had a single repair on the Tesla and the dreaded battery degradation has been almost nothing. Plus my $300 a month gas bill with the Tacoma I had before is down to a $30 a month increase in my electric bill. Maybe Model 3s are made like crap but this is the first vehicle I've had for over 5 years that didn't spend a single second in the shop for a repair. My first car was a GMC that shipped with a bent rear axle and was totaled by 70K miles because of all the defects but people act like Tesla is the only manufacturer that has ever shipped a vehicle with any flaw.

Model y was the best selling car in the world, beating out Corolla, RAV4, and Camry. You don't think that's not indicative of them taking a significant chunk of the pie previously taken by value brands like Honda, and Toyota, I don't know what you would accept as an evidence of that happening. EV market is continuing to grow as more and more customers warm up to the idea and infrastructure growing. Toyota and Honda doesn't have any popular pure electric vehicle, which will cost them when they have to get the manufacturing line up and running while unable to reduce COGS from ramping production. Ford, Hyundai/Kia, and Volkswagen will eat up Toyota and Honda's market share by simply being there with competitive products long before Toyota's first compelling EV products hit the market. I think Honda and Toyota's lack of EV prowess and their executives' reluctance to adjust to a new matket paradigm will cost them dearly in the medium and long term. Keep in mind, Tesla's profit margin even at it's currently much reduced price still spanks Honda's and Toyota's margin against their gas vehicles already.

"I'm not claiming lithiums are completely safe. Any form of potential energy is dangerous whether it's physical from a spring(say coilovers)or chemical from batteries. It all depends on the fail-safes that are in place. A bms, especially an on board bms is the last line of defense aside from physically rupturing the battery. The same can be said for a gas tank. This is why most cells are cylindrical in shape because they are mechanically stronger than pouch-style cells. And if all else fails, LiFePo4 are, currently, the safest lithium chemistry available. The NMH battery just popped because, well, it has less energy density than a LiFePo4 cell of the same size. Cell failure has to equalize and tbh, I'd rather it equalize in a slow smoking manner than a larger, potentially more dangerous ""pop"". If you're putting a bare LiFePo4 cell on a Xtar charger and set it to the wrong chemistry, then it's user error. Not judging, I've made mistakes myself. I have had physical cell failures due to poor balancing. Discharging and recycling the pack was in order and that was what I did. Since 2009, battery technology is improving but you and I have seen it many years ago because we wanted to push the limits. You with rc cars and me with ebikes.

"Well it took a while to catch on. Delorean has come back. To bad John isn’t around to see it. In the 80’s big dog car manufacturers had the political pull to destroy a small car manufacturer. John (as last resort) took to large drug deals trying to save his company and its my opinion FEDs set him up for this via the big dog car companies political donations. Like here’s your money big gov now use the FBI and get rid of Delorean. They even tried the same tactic with Musk. Didn’t work. Then they tried using the IRS and the SEC. Both agencies got sued and Musk won. They even tried buying up the lithium/nickel markets and using the epidemic to disrupt the auto chip manufacturing with a shortage but only ended up hurting themselves. Musk started making his own chips in factory. Then they went after his bank loans. All while he was working 100+ hour weeks in his factories, sleeping on his office floor to keep Tesla alive. Its wild story but Elon managed to produce and sell just enough cars and make just enough money to legally (with lawsuit threats) to keep the banks at bay. Took him 3 years. And in the mean time the shorters of Tesla lost billions expecting his car company to go bust. Now, what Musk created is unstoppable. He could drop dead and it would change nothing for Tesla or Space X. This is why the govt hates this man with a passion. Because they could’t stop him. There will prob be a movie one day.

"I've been a TSLA investor since 2011 and follow the company's activities very closely. The Cybertruck concept was introduced in 2019, and Tesla planned to deliver by 2021. However, the pandemic and associated industrywide supply chain issues led them to delay Cybertruck and concentrate on ramping Model Y production instead. Keeping the supply chain simpler was the right call, from an operational perspective. The same goes for the Semi and Roadster. Quality control issues are much lower at Tesla's newer factories. Shanghai-built Teslas are probably among the most precisely assembled vehicles in the world. Look at the actual financial results in the SEC 10-Q and 10-K forms. Tesla is steadily profitable, generates decent cash flow, has almost no recourse debts now, and continues to grow at a fast pace for a business that is still primarily heavy industry. Your criticisms are not grounded in reality",15-07-2023,,

"No, see you really don't know what you're talking about. It's not a ""dumb"" comparison. You said EV is better in every way, I clearly gave an example of how it isn't. Ships don't use electric engines, they use diesel or nuclear. The most reliable buses and lorries are running on diesel. There's also the difference in time for refuelling that electric completely fails on, less than five minutes to fill up the fuel tank in a petrol/diesel car. The internal combustion engine has a higher energy density, meaning it produces a higher energy output per density of fuel. Funny how all the electric buses rolled out have been failures, even the hybrid ones have to rely on the diesel motor predominantly. Like I said, there's a reason why diesel is used across commercial, industrial and military services. Go have your left wing wet dream, reality will always correct you.",19-07-2023,296.0400085,291.2600098

For a 7.5k tax credit, you are thinking to buy a Tesla I think is at the least 50K which tells me you aren't thinking healthy, not to criticize, but why wouldn't you pay the tax instead of Tesla liability! and risk to lose your credit and 'coming to america?' Going overseas still means you need a lot of money after all you don't want to be starting from bottom there as the locals do You need money. If you aren't going there with at least 500K, it might not be an easy life after all Then again if you have 500K, just pay your taxes. Have a talk with IRS and negotiate a cut and a payment plan. I know many people living overseas, they just had enough of the rat race, the dating scene in US, they just enjoy the simple life with less. No worries to careers etc but I don't know anyone doing it because they owe taxes. One guy I know gets a pension from his job in his early 50s , not even retired , one guy owns two properties in US and collects rent living in DR etc etc...

Not paying taxes legally is something you need to plan for years ahead of time; you don’t have enough of a lead here to set it up properly. So, you’re gonna have to pay those taxes. You can installment agreement. But it’s best to just write the damn check. Don’t forget; you made money on yolo’s through the American stock market and American business and political policies. It’s only fair that you pay your fair share of the profit only into the system that supports that free market. I should note; you can’t run many places.

"It's impressive how people still misread the debt numbers. Not even after 2 decades of Japan chugging along with 200% debt to GDP ratio people still don't get it. Nominal debt is a useless number, debt to GDP is less irrelevant than nominal debt but still irrelevant. Yearly fiscal revenue vs debt payments is a little bit more relevant, but you also have to consider the cost of new debt and the government's capability of increasing revenue or decreasing expenditure. But more importantly you also have to consider what currency is the debt denominated on. These are all factors why Japan's 200% debt to GDP ratio is not that important, and in the case of the US it's even less important. It does make a compelling story for conspiracy theorist, but it's pretty much useless in real life if you're to be making decisions about your own money.

I can't tell if what you're saying is good or bad. Like if the debt is just one year of gdp then that means it's not as bad right? Like better to owe $50k in debt and have a $50k salary a year than have $50 million in debt and a $50k salary. Also from what I've looked into and understand a huge portion of US debt is held by the US taxpayers. Basically money that was put into things like social security was all taken out with an IOU. So we could technically cancel that debt and no one has to pay anything more than they already have but we might lose social security. So if we for example save and pay down the debt with 5% of the gdp we can pay it off in 20 years. Overall I think the whole debt thing is blown out of proportion by fear mongering.

"Paying down the national debt, the federal debt, is a horrible idea anyway. Some will go down as the economy goes along, sure, because tax revenues will raise. But the debt itself isn't going to bankrupt the government. It's denominated in US Dollars, and the sole source for US Dollars is the national government of the United States. It's a monopoly, it literally can't go bankrupt in US Dollars, because it's spending is how the dollars get into the economy in the first place. Taxes don't fund the federal government, the government spends money into existence (via..you know..spending) using it's agents (the private banks) via the treasury/fed. Once a dollar is taxed back by the government, it ceases to exist as money. (Think an IOU that you gave to a friend then got back afterwards) The national debt is nothing more than the list of all the money the US Government has spent, that it hasn't taxed back out of existence. What the money is spent on CAN cause problems (inflation for example if the government decided it was going to buy up all the construction work, and got into a bidding war with the private sector) if it's not spent wisely, but spending in general isn't a bad thing, and is in fact a great thing. Put it this way, by basic accounting identity, every dollar spent has to be a dollar saved by somebody. The ""national debt"" of the federal government has to be the private savings of everything that isn't that government. Meaning you, me, Amazon, Walmart, whoever. The idea that the debt is something we have to worry about because it's a big number is just something that's talked about by people who either don't know better, or who want to push a political ideology that impoverishes the masses to the benefit of the few. And anyone..ANYONE who talks to you about the national debt by referencing ""your household spending"" is not worth listening to. [link](https://moslereconomics.com/mandatory-readings/innocent-frauds/) If anyone doubts this is the case, just follow what the fed chairmen have let slip. When they spent 29 trillion dollars to end the great recession's financial crisis (40% of which went out of the country..you're welcome Europe, for the bailout of your banking sector) the chairman was asked on, iirc, 60 minutes about it being tax dollars he lets slip that it wasn't tax dollars, it was all new spending...because that's how it works.",31-07-2023,267.480011,267.4299927

"I mean, this isn't a totally fair shake either. If you add up the obligations the US government has which don't show up in the usual federal debt numbers, like social security and pensions and the like, the actual debt owed is probably closer to 100 trillion. Now, you're right that in and of itself, that's not a problem... The problem comes from some of the assumptions baked into that paradigm with respect to growth of GDP, interest rates on bonds, etc. and their effects on actually servicing that debt. In my opinion a lot of that is over-optimistic and there are many examples, like Greece, of what happens when someone finally has to pay the piper and there is no money there. Now obviously Greece isn't a good analogy because they were tied to the Euro and didn't have the freedom to just print money, but there are still some valid concerns about unlimited debt.",31-07-2023,267.480011,267.4299927

"bonds aren't really debt though, as the rest of the economy experiences it, they're a form of cash that pays some interest. The reason it's called debt is just accounting tradition. The bonds are there because the government wants to delay spending by the public, hopefully for some public purpose, and so it offers a form of the dollar that pays you interest in exchange for not spending the larger amount of your principle. And it's not irresponsible to have a large national debt, spending on some things can be irresponsible (for example, the military but not the unemployed or schools or something). Having a national debt is required to be a net importer (or reserve currency if you prefer) and having a prosperous economy. The only way around it is to get your demand from outside (net exporter) but that has a lot of costs too, for example..the real economy can suffer (the stuff you make gets used by somebody else and all you have is their money).

"I think you are pointing out a correct fact, that the actual debt is larger than we realize, but you're missing the overall point that the debt doesn't really matter. What matters is whether you can remain productive enough to pay that debt. Imagine if you owned a home and as long as you remained productively employed you could borrow money against that home for near zero interest. If that was the case, would it make sense to let your house fall into disrepair? If you had a hole in your roof, would it be more financially prudent to borrow money at that low interest rate to fix the roof? Or should you be putting a tarp over the hole so that you don't have to borrow any more money? The economic approach to debt is not a one size fits all solution for all nations. It is dependent on the productive capacity of the nation and it's purchasing power. A country like the US has near-limitless productive capacity given it's geo-political advantages, but much like the roof on your house, maintaining that productive capacity requires investment. If you want to tap into the nation's potential, then it takes government investment into the things that drive future development, and one of the keys to future productivity is stability. If, on the other hand, the government becomes obsessed with paying down the debt and implements austerity policies, they will be pulling purchasing power out of the economy. There are times when this is a good idea, such as when the economy is red hot, but it doesn't work as a consistent policy. If you do this when the economy is on a natural downswing, it will deepen the recession which drives more people into poverty and pushes more people onto government assistance. This drives up the national debt, but rather than that debt going to improving productive capacity it is now going to unproductive expenditures like welfare and food stamps. This is why the national debt started rising after the implementation of Neo-Liberalism in the 1980's. They sought to reduce the role of government in the economy in order to bring down the national debt and allow the economy to function at a natural equilibrium. This ultimately limited government investment into infrastructure. Now, after 40-50 years of Neo-Liberalism, we are finding out that the tarp we put on the roof isn't working very well and we've driven up our debt buying new furniture rather than fixing the hole in the roof.",31-07-2023,267.480011,267.4299927

An interesting line: “*an upcoming meeting of leaders from Brazil, Russia, India and China in August may include the formal introduction of the new initiative.*” It goes on to say how things were calm while the US dollar was on the gold standard, then how the chaos started in 1971 when we moved off of it. Interestingly, you look at [this chart and can see pre-1971 inflation rates in the low 1%](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/inflation-rate-cpi) range up until 1971, and then… nonsense caused by uncontrolled government spending for the past 50 years.

"Wow great post. Thank you. I totally agree with what you are saying and in the private world, I think what you say makes sense as that debt is utilized in a efficient manner. It 100% is a smart decision to borrow debt when the interest rate is favorable to fix that hole in the roof, which benefits you for many years to come. However, I’d push back on your argument because we are talking about the government. The issue is that a significant portion of what the government spends on is not a one time payment. It becomes an obligation that persists year over year. Using your analogy, it is like borrowing to pay for that hole in the roof every year. And because of this, the borrowing HAS to be made regardless of what interest it is at. Now that may not be an issue for now given how dependent the world is on the USD, and the Fed can theoretically print as much as they want, but it is actions like these that begin the transition of the new economic world order. As much as it seems impossible that the world moves away from a currency currently so entrenched, that seemed the case with all previous reserve currencies. And in the meantime, if no regard is given to debt, inflation may pick back up, hurting the paycheck to paycheck families most. And if not inflation, then asset bubbles, further increasing the wealth gap as that debt money mostly travels to the pockets of the wealthy. The danger of the debt of the government is that it can always be kicked down the road, but it’s like a snowball, the longer and further you kick it, the bigger the problem gets. And regarding the government paying down the debt. I hope it happens but with each passing year, I find it harder to see that happening. Even in the good years our deficit and borrowing has only increased. We are on the trajectory that the actual discretionary spending portion the budget is getting smaller and smaller, eaten away by entitlements and interest, how then does one pay off that debt in a meaningful way? Part of the reason I’m so negative is that anyone candidate who wants to be fiscally responsible will not get elected. After all, how do you win against another candidate that talks about expanding all sorts of programs, yet conveniently leaving out how that will be financed?

"GDP is a calculation. Certain assumptions and biases go into the calculation as to what to include and what not to include. For example, unpaid work and volunteering aren’t included even though they contribute to a society. Unpaid work does contribute to an economy. We then use that calculation to conclude that GDP growth is up 2% therefore the economy is in a good or improving place. It doesn’t then assess that figure through any other lenses. For example, if GDP growth is up 2% where does the additional wealth go? Was it additional profits or wages? What distribution was the growth? If the bulk of it went to the top 1% then the rich got richer and the working class got poorer (because of inflation). I’d argue in that scenario that growth may be 2% but your economy got weaker because more of your populations spending power reduced.

"I don't think it is relevant to point out that the borrowing is an ongoing expense and not a one-time payment. To continue with the homeownership analogy, the roof isn't you're only expense. There are other costs like utilities, general maintenance, etc that are ongoing expenses. The point is that if you have the ability to do it, you pay what you have to pay to maintain your house, then you worry about the debt or surplus later. The same goes for a nation. You pay what you need to pay to keep the market stable, then you tax some money back so that inflation doesn't get out of control. With regard to the issue of the national debt, again, the total amount does not really matter. What matters is your debt-to-GDP ratio, and even that is not a hard limit. The people who said that the national debt matters have been predicting Japan's collapse since the 1990s, but it still hasn't happened despite their debt-to-GDP being over 200%. Usually, when someone makes a specific prediction and that prediction doesn't come true, we can safely assume that the prediction was wrong. The debt-to-GDP matters because it becomes a drag on the economy, not because it will cause the economy to collapse. There is going to be a debt-to-GDP ratio for any nation where the drag on the economy becomes too much and the country falls behind. The challenge is to find that balance between money going into the economy and money being pulled out. I like Anwar Shaikh's explanation of inflation as a complex interplay between: A) Investment vs savings; B) Government spending vs taxation; and C) Imports vs exports All of these areas of the economy will impact inflation in different ways, and they can also impact each other which has knock-on effects that are hard to predict. I think this is a far better explanation for inflation than Friedman's ""inflation is first and foremost a monetary phenomenon"", which is basically saying that A is the only thing that matters and neither B nor C has any real impact on inflation. Japan has set up its corporations to manufacture products in the countries of sale, not in Japan. As a result, Japan imports a lot for its own consumption but doesn't export a lot. When you import things, you put your currency in the bank and take out foreign currency to pay for the item. This reduces the amount of your currency in circulation which reduces inflation. Therefore, because of the unique circumstances of Japan's economy, they are able to maintain a much higher debt-to-GDP ratio than other countries without experiencing inflation. The same economic program would not work in a country with an export-driven economy. In terms of a policy proposal, I think Mark Blyth nailed it with his idea that you need a tax code that automatically flexes with the GDP growth. If you have a year with higher GDP growth, the tax rate is higher. If you have a slow year with low growth, the tax rate is lower. Therefore, if your economy runs hot, it is automatically cooled by higher taxes, but if your economy is struggling, it gets a boost from the lower tax rates. This would eliminate the role of politicians in managing the tax rate directly, which helps to keep it from becoming a political football. It would also decouple government spending from tax income, so any government surplus would go directly to the national debt. The government services have already been paid for with the debt, and any excess tax income is just going toward that debt with the rest of the tax income. It isn't a tax surplus that can now be spent on something else.",31-07-2023,267.480011,267.4299927

"I can't keep up with these comments, but I also don't want to leave them unaddressed. 1) I bought long put calendar spreads, so I STILL OWN THE LONG LEGS in addition to the 200 shares. In theory, my max loss at the end of all this should be no more than the $10 difference between selling the short put and buying the long put. In other words, Robinhood exercised HALF of each contract, and the other half will make it neutral. 2) It was terrifying as fuck to open the app and see this. My goal in sharing the experience is to urge other idiots to exercise more caution than I did, which means the educational piece of it is really important. Here are some of the explanations provided by RH: - ""Early assignment happens when you sell an options contract and are asked to fulfill its terms before expiration. It may result in an account deficit if it causes you to use more buying power than you have available."" - ""This can be a normal part of options trading. When a buyer chooses to exercise a contract with your particular strike price and expiration date, your contract may be assigned at random."" - ""When you are assigned, you have the obligation to fulfill the terms of the contract. When you sell-to-open an options contract, you can be assigned at any point prior to expiration (regardless of the underlying share price)."" - ""If you’re assigned on the short leg (the put contract you sold) of your spread, you have the obligation to buy shares of the underlying security at the strike price."" - ""If your long leg of a put spread is out of the money, you can sell the long leg of your spread, then separately sell the shares you need to cover the assignment."" - ""Example: You enter an XYZ put spread, so you buy one put contract of XYZ (the long leg) and sell one put contract of XYZ (the short leg). When your short leg is assigned, you buy 100 shares of XYZ, which may put your brokerage account in a deficit of funds. You can’t exercise the long leg to cover the deficit in your account since it’s out of the money. Instead, you can sell the put contract you own, then separately sell the 100 shares of XYZ you just received from the assignment to help cover the deficit in your account.""",03-08-2023,252.0399933,259.3200073

"In the account settings you will see if the account type is ""margin' or 'cash' (it's probably margin) A margin account doesn't necessarily involve borrowing money to trade, but the brokerage is ""lending you money"" in certain instances behind the scenes. Such as - if you have a margin account and have an option go ITM at expiry, the brokerage (not RH probably lol, but other brokerages) would likely exercise the option and sell the shares, netting you the difference between closing price and strike. You technically would need to have a margin account unless your account has enough cash to actually hold those shares. If you ever hear people post about 'switch to a cash account, no day trading restrictions!' - a cash settled account means if you have $1000 account on monday, you can make $1000 worth of trades, close them all, no issues, but you won't have your buying power restored until the next day for options, or 2 days for shares [per RH support page, you almost certainly have a margin account if you are opening spreads](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/)",03-08-2023,252.0399933,259.3200073

"Per RH: - ""Early assignment happens when you sell an options contract and are asked to fulfill its terms before expiration. It may result in an account deficit if it causes you to use more buying power than you have available."" - ""This can be a normal part of options trading. When a buyer chooses to exercise a contract with your particular strike price and expiration date, your contract may be assigned at random."" - ""When you are assigned, you have the obligation to fulfill the terms of the contract. When you sell-to-open an options contract, you can be assigned at any point prior to expiration (regardless of the underlying share price)."" - ""If you’re assigned on the short leg (the put contract you sold) of your spread, you have the obligation to buy shares of the underlying security at the strike price."" - ""If your long leg of a put spread is out of the money, you can sell the long leg of your spread, then separately sell the shares you need to cover the assignment."" - ""Example: You enter an XYZ put spread, so you buy one put contract of XYZ (the long leg) and sell one put contract of XYZ (the short leg). When your short leg is assigned, you buy 100 shares of XYZ, which may put your brokerage account in a deficit of funds. You can’t exercise the long leg to cover the deficit in your account since it’s out of the money. Instead, you can sell the [long] put contract you own, then separately sell the 100 shares of XYZ you just received from the assignment to help cover the deficit in your account.""",03-08-2023,252.0399933,259.3200073
"There are a number of types of option types you can open that are paired with another option contract. When you pair opposing contracts and one of them gets closed, you're left with the risk/profit on the other ""leg."" Basically, make sure you watch it like a hawk or set up an automated closure rule which can be done in most trading apps so that you don't get stuck with something that's worthless or worse, that you'll owe money on.

"OP was hedging with a put spread. So they both sell (short leg) and buy (long leg) put options of the same stock in equal amounts at the same time.

Then you exercise your long options and sell the shares that you got from your short position at the higher strike price. Your profit is the difference between the strike prices and premiums. &#x200B; Early assignment is if your short part of the trade gets exercised earlier. So now you gotta buy the shares from someone but but you don’t have anyone who would buy them from you yet.

"You can safely sell calls and puts. **Selling a cash secured put is actually safer than buying 100 stock** because your risk is lowered by the upfront money. Typically u also get a lower price. Same with selling stock, might as well get paid a bit and sell for a higher set price. OP did 0$ upfront spreads. Spreads are the issue here. Spreads is like playing Russian roulette and the prize is a 5$ bill. I don’t fuck with spreads. Theta gang will always win.",03-08-2023,252.0399933,259.3200073

"Hi OP, actually after thinking about it for awhile, I think getting exercised in the short leg is good for you, since you have already earned the full premium from selling the short put. Now you should sell both the assigned shares and the long leg puts asap, and hopefully be in the green :) Do not exercise the long legs as you will lose out on the intrinsic theta value.",03-08-2023,252.0399933,259.3200073

Obviously it can't account for early assignment and then settling at some lower price in the morning when it sells but it **knows** this will happen and shouldn't be telling your your in debt for 100 shares of the stock when you WILL have 100 shares to cover the other direction in the morning. It should basically just say something like ""this leg was assigned, meaning you just bought/sold 100 shares of this stock.

It's a lot more likely when it's already deep itm. Partly why those calendar spreads are so cheap far out and itm. This can be avoided with European options like SPX but Robinhood of course doesn't have that option. And other brokerages tend to be more picky about letting you buy/sell spreads.,03-08-2023,252.0399933,259.3200073
"Yeah not 100% on the reasoning but no matter what time of day it happens you don't get notified until after market closes. And Robinhood really does make it look tempting On the Profit/Risk chart. But doesn't explain that the reason why they are so cheap is they are already likely to be exercised.

If it was just a calendar spread the most they should lose is the cost of the spread since even far out and itm the longer leg will be more expensive. But if it was...diagonal or had it been a debit spread they'd essentially lose the difference between the strike prices. And if it's multiple diagonals or wide ones. Can still be a big hit. Oh and while it's possible if the stock moves in their favor it can work out. But the window on that is the overnight since Robinhood and friends will auto exercise the long leg. So pretty small.,03-08-2023,252.0399933,259.3200073

"You may be interested in the academic courses of Behavioral Economics, Applied Economics, and/or Behavioral Finance. (I suggest applied econ if you're into a more technical view.) Unfortunately these courses are offered at the end of programs, so most undergrads only get a taste of econ 101 then spend the rest of their life talking about infinite timescales and supply demand curves. They're extremely technical, but ultimately the true reality of the world [in our lifetime]. _____ All that to say: What you, and Burry, are stuck on is the application of a technical understanding to the pragmatic reality of the market/life. Not to say Burry doesn't understand this, but that he doesn't care because he doesn't need to. Infinite timescales do not exist, and we live within the in-between area of the graph.",15-08-2023,238.7299957,232.9600067

"The mechanism behind a short is you borrow a stock, sell it, and rebuy it in the future when you want to close the short. This is what happens behind the scenes when you short through a broker. You cash in on the difference if the stock price is lower than when you opened the short. blibblub is right that losses are theoretically unlimited because if the stock keeps going up, you’d have to pay more to rebuy the stock and give it back to the lender when you want to close the short. An option is a contract which gives someone the right but not the obligation to purchase shares of a company at a specified price (strike) on a specific date (expiry). The price you pay for the option is the premium. If you buy a put with a strike price lower than the current share price, and the share price drops below the strike price before expiration, generally the option will be worth more than when you bought it. At least with American style options, you can “sell to close” before expiry. All these terms I used have significance, and you should understand how options work before buying. Since options are usually used for insurance against price movements, it is not recommend to use them for speculation on stock price movement.

Better to spend 25M pushing the problem down the road than to lose 2BN today. Not to mention, in 2005 no one took Burry seriously so no one thought anything of his bet.
